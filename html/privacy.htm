  The privacy policy on this page is specifically for the revision and study support app developed through Lancaster 
  University Leipzig, and in use for Digital Systems module at Leipzig and Advanced Digital Design at Sunway University.<br>
<br>
  The content is derived from the standard student privacy policy available through the Lancaster University privacy 
  page: <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/privacy/student-privacy" target="_blank">Privacy</a>.

  <h3>App Privacy Policy</h3>

This Privacy Notice explains how we will collect, use, disclose and protect your personal data. Most data that we 
collect is generally not considered personal data.<br>
<br>
The Notice applies to any students who download and use the Digital Systems or Advanced Digital Design app. This 
research study will process your data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).

<h4>What information do we collect from you?</h4>
The only personal information we collect from you is your institutional email address (i.e.\ student@lancaster.ac.uk or 
student@imail.sunway.edu.my). We collect non-personal information such as your current score and progress with the 
questions in the app. These are required for the basic functionality within the app.<br>
<br>
If you consent to be part of the research study, we also collect information on how you answer questions in the app. As 
this is part of a separate research study, this consent will only be requested and processed outside the app, as 
approved by Lancaster University Research Ethics under case number FST-2024-4759-RECR-3.

We do not collect any further information from you through the app.


<h4>Who do we share your information with?</h4>

Only researchers associated with the research project will have access to the data within the app:<br>
<br>
Dr James Stovold, Lancaster University Leipzig (PI) <br>
Assoc. Prof. Ir. Dr Ranjit Singh Sarban Singh, Sunway University, Malaysia (CI) <br>


<h4>Do we transfer your data to third party countries?</h4>

Sometimes we may need to share your app data between Lancaster University and Sunway University (Malaysia). Any app 
data that is transferred between these universities will be anonymised beforehand. <br>
<br>
When it is necessary to share your data with organisations outside of the European Union, we will ensure that there are 
appropriate safeguards in place, thereby offering a comparable level of protection of your data as within the EEA.

<h4>How do we keep your information secure?</h4>

The University has robust Information Security policies in place to protect your information. All staff in the 
University have a responsibility to make sure that your data is handled securely. For further information please refer 
to the University’s Information Security Policy.

<h4>How long do we keep your information?</h4>

We are required to hold the anonymised data for a minimum of 10 years. For further information please refer to the 
University’s retention schedule.

<h4>What are your rights?</h4>
You have the following rights regarding your data:

To have access to your data; 
To have inaccurate or incomplete data amended;
To have your data deleted - this can only be completed before the data has been anonymised, after this point we are 
unable to delete some data.

To restrict the use of your personal data;
To request personal information in a digital form so that you can provide to other organisations;
To object to automated decision making and profiling;
To withdraw consent when we have used consent as the basis for using your information (up to the anonymisation date 
which will be shared with you while taking consent)

The University has further information on data subject rights.

If you wish to exercise your rights you are advised to first read this information as there are some exceptions to 
using your rights. 
<br>
<br>
Any requests to use your rights over your data should be made to either the PI of the project (James Stovold), or 
the University’s designated Data Protection Officer.

<h4>Who do I contact for further information or if I have concerns?</h4>
The project Principal Investigator is:<br>
<br>
Dr James Stovold, Assistant Professor in Computer Science<br>
Email: j.stovold [at] lancaster.ac.uk<br>
