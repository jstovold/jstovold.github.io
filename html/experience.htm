 <h3>Work Experience</h3>

 In contrast to the 'typical' route through academia, I opted to move to industry after my PhD instead of taking a postdoc research 
position. Some of my jobs and internships are listed below.

 <h4>Hiscox Insurance, London </h4>
 <i>Data Analyst, Group Underwriting Insights </i> 
  <br />
  <br />
 Responsible for running proof-of-concept projects to demonstrate the effectiveness of predictive analytics 
and advanced computer science techniques within insurance. This consists of rapid development of prototypes 
and analysis of outcomes, forming recommendations for the executive directors. I was involved in various 
projects, including: text analysis/NLP, web scraping, real-time geographical mapping of catastrophes, 
stochastic simulations of likely futures, improving efficiency of catastrophe modelling models, and 
demonstrating the impact of parallel/cloud computing for modelling.
 <br />
 <br />
 Working in this position gave me exposure to the inner workings of corporate strategy. It also taught me the 
value of storytelling when presenting information to decision-makers. 
 <br />
 <br />
 <h4>Cambridge Innovation Consulting, Cambridge </h4>
 <i>Principal Consultant, Head of Emerging Digital Technology</i>
 <br />
 <br />
  Responsible for liaising with industry clients to how academic research could impact their company. This 
consisted of working with the executive directors of major corporations, assembling teams of academic experts, 
and managing the projects.
 <br />
 <br /> 
 Within 3 months of starting, I landed the consultancy’s only RFP and was running a ~£150k global project.
 <br />
 <br />
 <h4>BAE Systems Advanced Technology Centre, Bristol</h4> 
 <i>Research Associate, Electro-optical Technology</i>
<br />
<br />
 Worked as part of a team of physicists, mathematicians and software engineers researching new ways of 
exploiting electro-optical technology for use in the defence industry. Developed hyperspectral and 
polarimetric algorithms, real-time spectral tracking systems and new camera technologies to help overcome some 
of the fundamental problems with modern camera systems.
 <br />
<br />
 As part of my time at the Advanced Technology Centre, I won an award for my part in developing hyperspectral 
algorithm plugins for Socet GXP (another BAE Systems product), and I was also nominated for a second award for 
my part in a systems trial in particularly difficult conditions.
 <br />
<br />
 <h4>Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets, London</h4>
  <i>Business Architect, IT Architecture</i> 
<br />
<br />
 Worked with a group of enterprise and business architects to develop a data standard for the Capital Markets 
business and to improve the performance of various SQL scripts and server systems through the development and 
use of bespoke monitoring software.
 <br />
<br />
 As part of my work I automated many of the group's data modelling processes, to increase productivity and 
help maintain the projects' momentum within the business. I also reviewed new technology for the group, 
including writing white papers and making recommendations based on my findings.
