Lord Swann</h1>

<p>Lord Swann was a distinguished member of the University of York, 
Chancellor for many years.  The following tribute was carried by the
<i>University Review 1989-90</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>Lord Swann</strong></p>

<p>Lord Michael Swann FRS, Chancellor of the University since 1979, died on
22 September 1990.</p>

<p>Michael Swann was born on 1 March 1920.  He was an exhibitioner at
Winchester where he was taught chemistry by Lord James, our first vice-chancellor.
he went up to his father'[s college, Gonville &amp; Caius, and after the 
war was elected to a Fellowship there in 1946.  Sic years later he was 
appointed to the Chair of Natural History at Edinburgh University and 
in 1962 became a Fellow of the Royal Society.  His main interest as a 
research biologist was in cell physiology and in particular fertilisation,
mitosis and cell division - nearly all the work being done on the eggs of
sea-urchins.  After a spell as Dean of the Faculty of Science, he served an
eight-year term as Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh.
This was a time of rapid expansion and though the appointment of 
another scientist caused open resentment in some quarters, Michael rapidly
gained the confidence of the University as a whole because of the firm,
judicious and courteous way in which he conducted policy-making internally
and the obviously beneficial influence his powerful presence had upon the
University's reputation in the outside world.  It was, however, also a
time of serious student troubles and of difficulties over the Rectorship
of the University which made meetings of the Court particularly wearisome.
Unfortunately Michael allowed himself to become unduly emotionally involved
in these affairs, many of which were deeply offensive to one of his
sensitive nature, and he yearned for change.</p>

<p>The offer of the Chairmanship of the MMC came just at the right time.
From all accounts he was very successful there.  his big, genial
presence fitted in well with the atmosphere that permeated the Corporation.
He enjoyed the job immensely; and probably his most important legacy for
the future was the protection he established for the BBC against outside
influences that threatened its independence.</p>

<p>During the 'eighties he undertook many public duties of which 
perhaps the best known and certainly most difficult was his assumption,
at a point of disorder and deadlock, of the Chairmanship of the 
Committee on the Education of Children from Ethnic Minorities.  In the
House of Lords he sat on the cross-benches and worked tirelessly in 
support of higher education.  It was a hard, tedious slog, calling
for considerable research and long sittings; and the result was
the alteration of a few clauses that the Government felt it unwise
to overturn.  In one sense it was a poor reward, but it was precious 
for all that.</p>

<p>He was an excellent Chancellor.  his presence on Degree Day added much to the dignity of the
occasion.  He never sought to interfere in policy matters but gave excellent
advice when asked and always wanted to be kept up to date with what was happening.
Just now and again he was able to put a word for us in high places when
the need seemed pressing.</p>

<p>I knew him well for over twenty years.  It was fun to be with him, for
he was a great talker, a man of wide interests and a lover of gossip
blessed with a wicked sense of humour.  I find it hard to look at his 
photograph and realise that in future I will only be able to enjoy the memory
of all that.  The University, too, is the poorer for his early, wholly
unexpected death.</p>

<p>Berrick Saul<br>Vice-Chancellor</p>
