Balloon Landing at Derwent Barbecue</h1>

<p>From: <a href="mailto:robert@aurora.york.ac.uk">Robert Bunting</a></p>

<p>It was the summer of 1989, and
Derwent barbecue was getting into full swing down on Campus.  I say down
on campus, because being a resident of Alcuin at that time, I was sitting
at a bench on the patio outside Alcuin bar, enjoying a pint on a warm
summer's evening, and surveying from up on the hill the goings on among 
the lesser types in the lower marshy bits.  It goes like this...</p>

<p>During the evening, someone looked up and noticed a balloon going over
head, not overly far up.  The wind was very light, so it was drifting along
very slowly, toward the general direction of Derwent.  As it went over, it
appeared to be losing height, and it's purpose was apparent... to aim for
the space in the middle of Derwent/Langwith colleges and land inside the
event.  (Derwent Barbecue then, as now, had some sort of fencing around it
to keep non-payees out.  Don't think they had quite so many marquees in 
those days though.) Anyhow, it obviously wasn't quite on line, and
with a burst of gas flame it rose up again to land in the fields beyond. 
A few minutes later, a car with trailer behind came along the university
road, and turned up to the library.  After some time (maybe half an hour,
maybe less.. how long does it take to get a balloon airborne?), said
balloon came over again, about the same height, slightly different line,
in another attempt.  This went on for a while, keeping the Alcuin drinkers
not a little amused, until perhaps the fourth or so attempt, when a
successful landing was apparently made inside the event.<p>
