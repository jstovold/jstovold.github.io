Oak Phone Box at King's Manor</h1>

<p>The University News Sheet for March 1992 reports that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Oak Kiosk Unveiled</strong></p>

<p>The Estates Department's Joiner's Shop was delighted when John
Niklaus and Bill Burns gave us the task of building an oak-panelled
telephone kiosk in the entrance to King's Manor.</p>

<p>The whole of the construction was carried out in the University's
workshop.  The moulds and masons' mitres were skillfully reproduced as
authentically as is practically possible, using good quality English oak
which had been lying in the Joiner's timber store for many years.  Alas,
the same cannot be said of the panels, which, because of financial
restraints, were made with American oak-faced plywood.</p>

<p>The member of our joinery staff who was responsible for making and
fixing the kiosk was John Hobson, under the watchful eye of our
chargehand joiner Ken Whitehead.</p>

<p>John, who joined the University from the Joseph Rowntree Trust in
1985, works mostly in the workshop and welcomed to opportunity to work
down at King's Manor.</p>

<p>The hoarding is now down and this fine improvement is there for
staff, students and visitors to enjoy.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the disruption to the entrance area, the Estates
Department's electrical staff have made radical improvements to the
wiring, which is now concealed beneath new plasterwork.</p>

<p>A job of this sort gives us a chance to show off now and again!</p>
