Vagrant in Langwith Bathroom</h1>

<p>From the September 1995 <i>Grapevine</i>, who got it from the
June 1995 <i>Nouse</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A vagrant who had made his home in a college bathroom has been the
subject of a number of police call-outs this term, including a cross campus
chase with a police dog after residents of Langwith C block realised
they could not allow him to stay.</p>

<p>On one occasion the cleaners arriving in the morning were forced to
open a bathroom door from the outside.  Its inhabitant, who had been asleep
in the bath, was chased away from the building by a cleaning lady wielding a
mop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fitting of locks to all external college doors should make this 
incident a thing of the past.</p>
