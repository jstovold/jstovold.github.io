The passing of vuft</h1>

<p>`vuft' was the world-famous Computer Science terminal room at York.
(see the <a href="compsci.html#vuft">Computer Science Folklore</a> to find out
why it is called vuft.)  When the department moved to it's shiny new
building next to the library in September 1997, vuft was closed.  The
following obituary appeared in the york.cs newsgroup:</p>

About 3pm on 26th August 1997 our dear friend Vuft was cruelly taken from
us.  Vuft had a long and glorious career as a room full of Spods and on
occasion nervous students attempting desperately to finish projects on
time.  Vuft did not go quietly and passed away struggling to the bitter
end.

The final words, imprinted forever upon a sheet of Decwriter paper, were
"lpcredit".  An epitaph for all to heed.

Vuft 1990-1997, RIP.

A short period of packet silence will be held in memory of Vuft.
