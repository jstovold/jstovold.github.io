Tower hacked!</h1>

<p>Dateline: Bank Holiday Monday, 11th May 1997, York University.</p>

<p>The story that follows is true.</p>

<p>Well, probably.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Twas a dark yet not so stormy evening over campus. All appeared
quiet as your narrator slowly made his way to the Vanbrugh
compsci room with the intention of checking his email before the
long night ahead. As I sat down I noticed a strange atmosphere
in the room yet took little notice. Several spods are staring at
their screens in dismay. I attempt to login.  Incorrect. I try
agian. Same again. What's going on? A bug? Mark's crashed tower
again? Exclamations come out across the room. Something's afoot!</p>

<p>A sudden noise across the room makes all turn. "Someone's hacked
into tower" comes the cry. No! Confusion reigns. Spods franticly
thump keyboards. Others look bemused. A cry. Yes, the man in the
corner? "It's coming  from somewhere with the initials b.y. Hold
on; Minsk!!!! In Byelorussia!" What? This is the start of much
frenzied activity.  Confused talk requests are exchanged with the
spod-pit. Computer Services are uncontactable, its 6pm on a Bank
Holiday. Runners are dispached to various porters, only to return
bearing messages of shaken heads. The hacker, it slowly emerges,
has disabled access to tower to all except himself, and has become
root. What dastardly deeds is he committing.</p>

<p>Over the next few hours an heroic struggle takes place, and I
was lucky enough to witness it. V058 becomes a hive of activity,
conferences are had around computers, voices struggle to be
heard. Someone in Derwent leaves to get some computing persons
phone number from his house, never to be heard from again. To all
intents and purposes, V058 has become the operations centre where our
saviours struggled for hours against the might of the East. Paths are
gradually uncovered, though progress is slow, with many a dead end
being uncovered.  It would be unfair to name one as the leader for
all here today made enormous sacrifices and everyone gave their all.</p>

<p>Suddenly a ray of hope emerges. A lonely compsci in Wenty has
found the way in. Advice and suggestions floods across the
wires. This brave individual now seems to be gaining. He has
to shut down tower. He gains control and begins the procedure,
painstakingly slowly it seems to the crowd of spods and onlookers
in the opperations centre. The message goes out warning all of
the impending shut down. Tension is mounting.  "Shut it down" is
muttered at the screen by many a spod. The excitement builds. Can
he do it? Suddenly a new message arrives. "F##k You". All stare
at eachother in amazement. Was this the invader or someone else
completely? If so who. We still do not know.</p>

<p>Then, without warning the system goes down. Afraid of loosing face
or having finished what he came for our visitor, knowing he was
into seconds left, shut it down himself. And left. Or did he? Still
too early to breath easily, the Wenty hero arrives at vuft, and
the checking begins. What did the invader do. How? And is he still
there? Vigorous checks are made, the valiant few still refusing to
give up on their vigil 'till all that could be done has been.</p>

<p>And so the dust settles. Many were effected, at the time of
writing, Tower is still down as a precuation. Questions must now
be answered, many I'm sure will be directed to computer services,
why are there so many gaps and inadequate protection? Why is there
nobody to contact in a situation like this? Yes, it could have waited
'till morning. Who knows, by then how much damage could have been
caused. How much was indeed caused, if any? Yet this should not
detract from those who worked tirelessly over this crisis, who I
would now like to pay tribute to. Though many of them I'm sure would
prefer to remain nameless to the general public, they know who they
are and they should feel proud of themselves tonight. Spods of V058,
Derwent, and everywhere else they were, I salute you.</p>
