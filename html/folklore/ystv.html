<a name="record">YSTV Holds/Held World Record</a></h1>

<p>In the 199th issue of University News Sheet, March 1988, the
following is reported</p>

<blockquote> <p><strong>Students Break TV Record</strong></p>

<p>Students at York are recovering from a mammoth event which broke the
world record for the longest television programme directed by one
person.  For 28 hours and 1 minute, York Student Television (YSTV)
broadcast live to its monitors on the University's cable network.</p>

<p>The programme, called Breaker 88, featured both contemporary and
classical music, a complete game-show competition, pool and dart, a
cabaret and magic show and countless interviews.</p>

<p>Programme director was Keith Hide-Smith, a third-year Computer
Science student.</p>

<p>During the programme, Keith was allowed only 5 minutes break every
hour.  ``Staying awake wasn't a big problem,'' he commented.  The
adrenaline and cups of black coffee kept me going.''</p>

<p>The production was mounted partly as a charitable event.  Several
hundred pounds were raised for the RNLI, Cancer Research, NSPCC and a
local community fund.</p>

<p>``Breaker 88 is very much a one-off,'' said Malcolm Heath, Station
Director.  ``YSTV's next project is coverage of the Students' Union
Elections in March.''</p>
