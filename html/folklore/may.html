The Mayflower</h1>

<p>The arrival of the Mayflower (the sculpture which once stood outside
Central Hall, and looked like a crisp) was documented by
the University News Sheet, issue 211, March 1990.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mayflower Arrives</strong></p>

<p>Mayflower 1, by local sculptor Michael Lyons has recently appeared
next to Central Hall.  Made of steel the sculpture was constructed in
conjunction with Mayflower Engineering of Sheffield. The simple form,
heightened by applied colour, is intended to hold its own in a large
open space.  Mayflower is on permanent loan, subject to an annual
review.</p>

<p>Michael Lyons lives in Cawood, near Selby, and studied sculpture at
Wolverhampton College of Art and the University of Newcastle.  He is
Head of the MA course in Fine Art at Manchester Polytechnic and a
founder member of the Yorkshire Sculpture Park.</p>

<p>In recent years he has concentrated mainly on steel for large works
and bronze for small pieces.  Some recent sculptures have been too big
for his studio and he has begun to liaise with local industry, working
alongside engineers and fabricators, in carrying out his ideas.</p>

<p>He has work sited in both rural and urban settings throughout the
country and the region.</p>

<p>Mayflower I was graffittied once or twice, and sadly was removed from
campus.  We have some pictures of the sculpture <a href="crisp1.jpg">with
graffitti</a> and <a href="crisp.gif">being cleaned</a>.</p>

<p>The sculpture has now been retired to a quiet garden in Cawood,
near the church.</p>
