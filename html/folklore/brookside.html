Brookside Filmed on Campus</h1>

<p>A spin off of the channel-4 series ``Brookside'', called ``Damon and
Debbie'', included scenes of Debbie visiting a University Open Day and
shots of the two of them in a terminal room (vuft -- which was specially
spruced up for the occasion.  Debbie got to use a sun3/50 which was
unheard of for undergraduates at that time).</p>

<p>The University News Sheet, Issue 196, October 1987, included this
article</p>

<p><strong>Brookside Lakeside</strong></p>

<blockquote> <p>A film crew from Mersey Television, makers of Channel
4's popular soap opera <em>Brookside</em>, were on campus on Saturday 19
September, filming scenes for a forthcoming spin-off series featuring
the character Damon Grant and his girlfriend Debbie.</p>

<p>Without wanting to spoil the plot for aficionados of the series, the
scenes filmed on Saturday form part of an episode in which Debbie visits
the University for an Open Day, and Damon has to search the entire
campus to try and find her.  He is seen passing the windows of various
rooms that we can see Debbie in, but he never turns his head in the
right direction at the right time!  The exterior shots were filmed
around the lake and by Central Hall. Interiors were shot in Computer
Science and Goodricke College.</p>

<p>Some of the tricks of the television trade were interesting to
observe.  For example, all the scenes of Damon running down corridors
throughout the University were shot in one corridor in the new computer
science building, with only subtle changes in furniture to distinguish
between them.  To fit in with the plot, the production crew set up a
bus stop outside Central Hall -- rumour has it that at one stage
14 conference-attending Samaritans were queued up by it!</p>

<p>One scene involved Debbie programming a computer to flash the words
``Damon loves Debbie'' on the screen.  As usual in television what you
see on the surface isn't what goes on behind the scenes and what was
supposed (in the script) to take Debbie a few minutes to do required
many hours of programming from my colleague Charles Forsyth, but, apart
from a slight hiccup when one of the actresses accidentally leant on a
keyboard and halted the running program, all went well.</p>

<p>Transmission of the three episode series on Channel 4 is scheduled for 4,
11 and 18 November, probably at 10 pm.  The scenes of York (both the
University and the City) will be concentrated in the first two episodes.
Don't miss it!</p>

<p>The event was also covered in <i>Nouse</i> at the time:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brookside on Campus</p>
<p>The makers of Channel 4's popular soap opera `Brookside' came to
campus on September 19, to film Debbie, the girlfriend of the
character Damon Grant, attending an open day.  Debbie, in `Brookside's'
normal ideologically sound way, is breaking down traditional stereotypes
by applying to read Computer Science.</p>
<p>But does she get an offer?  The script-writers are not revealing this
secret.  However, Dr Jim Briggs, of the Computing Department, said that
as Debbie managed to program the computer in just a few minutes to
flash the words `Damon loves Debbie' on the screen, while his colleague,
Charles Forsyth, took hours to do it, she is well above the required
standard for entry.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, Dr Briggs, the only `Brookside' fan in the
department, hopes that they - and the University as a whole - will
benefit from the free publicity.</p>
<p>Transmission of the York episodes - which will also be including
scenes from the city, where Damon is working in the Dick
Turpin Burger Bar, Coney Street - is scheduled for November 4
and 11, at 10pm.</p>
