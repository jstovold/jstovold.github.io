 <h3>Teaching</h3>
  <p>I have many years' teaching experience, including topics such as non-standard computing, neural 
networks, multi-agent interaction and games, programming, and AI in cyber-security. </p>

 <h4> Current Teaching Commitments </h4>
  <p>At present I am employed to co-ordinate the MAIG module at York (Multi-Agent Interaction and Games). This 
focusses on game theory, game tree search, Monte Carlo tree search, and reinforcement learning.</p>

 <p>Code snippets used in lectures are available <a href='https://github.com/jstovold/MAIG'>here</a>.</p>
