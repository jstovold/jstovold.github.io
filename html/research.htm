  <h4>General Research Interests</h4>
  <p>
    My research interests tend to lean towards anything 'weird' -- in particular, unconventional substrates 
for computing or computing in biological matter. At the moment I am looking at reservoir computers (such as 
echo-state networks and liquid-state machines) and finding ways of improving the computational power of simple 
reservoirs by coupling them together.

    While my research tends not to directly focus on methods, simulation and modelling play a large part in my 
research. Consequently, I have a large amount of experience working with numerical and agent-based 
simulations, along with appropriate analyses thereof.

  <h4>Doctoral Research</h4>
  <p>
    My PhD research focussed on the ability of a swarm of agents to make a decision, based on their current 
motive and the environmental context they are in. This has led to the development and publication of two 
algorithms: the first algorithm allows for the emergent formation of identity within a swarm; the second 
algorithm allows the swarm to make a collective decision, which is then used to adapt to a dynamic 
environment. Further to this, we are currently investigating the plausibility of applying this cognitive 
decision-making algorithm as a generic meta-heuristic.

  <h4>Masters Research</h4>
    My MEng project, titled '<i>Extending the Computational Application of Reaction-diffusion Chemistry by 
Modelling Artificial Neural Networks</i>', was investigating how different artificial neural models could be 
implemented using reaction-diffusion chemistry, and what this meant in terms of the computational application 
of the paradigm.
   <br />
   <br />
   Reaction-diffusion chemistry is a form of non-standard computation that uses the propagation of waves in a 
periodic chemical reaction as a representation of binary. By colliding or deflecting these waves, logical 
functions can be implemented. For example, the following image shows the propagation of two (simulated) 
chemical waves, which collide and raise the chemical concentration on the far side of the barrier high enough 
to produce an output wave. This is an implementation of a simple coincidence detector, or AND-gate.

   The work in my project was looking at how artificial neural networks could be implemented into this 
substrate. As spiking neurons intrinsically act as coincidence detectors, this seemed like a reasonable place 
to start.
