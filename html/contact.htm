  <h3>Contact</h3>
  It is always easiest to contact via email: <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/people/email/?to=jstovold" 
target="_blank">james.stovold [at] york.ac.uk</a>. If you do not receive a response within a week, I recommend 
re-sending the email.
  <br />  
  <br />  
  Although I try to keep regular office hours, this is not always possible, so if you would like to meet up 
please try to contact me beforehand (email is the easiest method for this). This also applies to phone calls 
(as my phone is in my office, it isn't always going to be answered, however I am happy to organise a time slot 
if you would like a chat over the phone -- again, email is the easiest method for this).
