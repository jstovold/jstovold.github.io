<h1>Jimi Hendrix Plays York</h1>

Bands played York once:
<a href="http://www.lionsgate.com/music/hendrix/">Digital Voodoo</a>
informs us that Jimi's concerts for 1967 included

<blockquote>
18-FEB  York University, York, Yorkshire                    England
</blockquote>

This was one of about 240 official concerts played that year, including
such venues as
<ul>
<li>	Marquee Club, London W1
<li>	Hollywood Bowl, Hollywood, California
<li>	Tulip Bulb Auction Hall, Spalding, Lincolnshire
</ul>

Well what do you know! My initial reaction was "No, doesn't ring any bells 
at all." But that just shows that the brain cells are fading fast. The Jimi 
Hendrix Experience played York University on 18 February 1967. According to 
bass player Noel Redding they didn't take the stage until 1 am so 
technically I suppose it was the 19th that they actually appeared. <p>

I'm afraid I don't have any press cuttings, ads ticket stubs etc for the 
gig. If you turn up anything further I'd certainly be interested in 
photocopies. No doubt you'll be diving into the Uni archives (I certainly 
would).

The Campus Archives in this case consist solely of back issues of the
Campus Newspaper <i>Nouse</i>.  This is very quiet on the event,
leading us to suspect that there might be an issue missing from the
archive in the library, which may have had a review.  What we do have is
the following advert in the previous paper: (Feb 16th 1967)<p>

It was a quarter page advert, no graphics or pictures just the text
with a box round it. Admission was apparently 6/-.<p>

There is a small and badly printed photo of Hendrix in the next paper, but
no indication of where and when it was taken!<p>
