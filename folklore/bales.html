Bales in the Lake</h1>

<p>The bales of straw in the lake were introduced following a very green
year: in summer 1993 the water turned <b>very</b> green.
The introduction of the bales was reported in the October 1994 <i>University
Magazine</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Feeding straw to the lake</strong></p>

<p>The campus lake will be fed straw this year in an effort to keep down the
algae blooms which cover it every summer.</p>

<p>Fifteen bales of straw wrapped in wire mesh will shortly be seen floating
in the lake.  The effect they have will not be noticable until next
year, however.</p>

<p>``The bales have an arresting effect on the growth of algae,'' says Gordon
Eastham, the University's new supervisor of grounds.  ``But they need to be
put in the water six months before the algae blooms to have the desired
effect.''</p>

<p>The bales, which will be anchored to prevent them drifting, will float
at first but will become submerged as they are waterlogged.  Marker buoys
will be attached so that grounds staff can identify them and remove them
after six months.</p>

<p>``It is partly a cosmetic exercise,'' says Gordon, ``but the water quality
will be better when there are fewer algae blooms.''</p>
