Student Occupations at York</h1>

<p>(More details to be added, sometime.)</p>

<h3>1960's: Heslington Hall</h3>

<p>Students campaigning for something or other occupied Hes Hall on
at least two occasions, possibly including an ``Open the Files'' occupation
in 1969.</p>

<h3>1970: Heslington Hall</h3>

<p>On March 3rd there was a General Meeting, at which it was voted
to occupy Hes Hall.  The students were compaigning over rights of 
access to confidential files alledgedly containing details of 
political and other activities by students.  About 60 people
occupied Heslington Hall overnight.  (No details about how it
ended yet.)</p>

<h3>Late 1970's: Library</h3>

<p>Students held a ``work-in'' overnight, as part of a protest about
grants.</p>

<h3>1978 or 1979: Heslington Hall</h3> 

Just before finals, Heslington Hall was occupied by students.  Andy Champ
spoke against the occupation at a Union Meeting and was quoted in
<i>Nouse</i>, but they called him ``Andy Capp''.  In those days, the quorum
for a UGM was 10% of not very many people, so a smallish number of 
people could swing a vote fairly easily.  At the next meeting about a
thousand people turned up and voted to end the occupation.

<h3>1982/3: Heslington Hall</h3>

<p>An article about this was apparently in Vision a few years ago.</p>

<h3>1988: Heslington Hall</h3>

<p>No details at present.</p>

<h3>1993: Central Hall</h3>

<p>Some of this is from memory for the time being. GRS</p>

<p>The occupations of Central hall were in December 1993 (Can't
remember what it was for. Possibly the grant cuts). Only a small number
of students took part, but they received messages of support from other
SUs, and even the peace campaigners from Menwith Hill. The vice chancellor
agreed with the demonstrating students' point (but not the occupation).</p>

<p>There were at least two occupations of Central Hall, following a
failed attempt to occupy Heslington Hall (staff locked the door and
refused admission).  The first took place on Sunday, when it was unused,
and the students were chucked out when admin wanted to use it next day.
Legend has it that they sent the SU a portering bill, there was certainly
some financial penalty involved.</p>

<p>The second occupation, a few days later, was a bit less tame.  In the end, there was an incident involving Bishwa B. Bandhari breaking a
window (Apparently he didn't do it, but he didn't deny having done it when he
was accused of it. For the publicity apparently.)  There was also a claim of
injury inflicted by a security guard or porter.  Bishwa was I think
given a suspended sentence by the University, if he had been kicked
out then he would have been deported.</p>

<p align=centre><strong>Steps in hand for eviction of sit-in students</strong></p>
<p align=centre>By Barbara Steeper</p>

<p>Legal action may be needed to remove more than 60 students occupying
part of York University in protest at government cuts to higher
education.</p>

<p>Peter Smith, senior assistant registrar at the university, yesterday
applied to the High Courts for a repossession order in a bid to get the
students evicted from the central hall.</p>

<p>The protest began earlier this week with the backing of the
university which said it was in total agreement with their stance on
grants cuts.</p>

<p>But the Student's Union voted to reoccupy the hall indefinitely and
yesterday said they would not move until they have an agreement that
disciplinary action will not be taken against those involved.</p>

<p>A children's carol concert is due to be staged in the hall tonight
and the university said it would take every legal step to make sure the
students were moved and the event could go ahead.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the university said she was disappointed at the
situation as everything possible was already being done to lobby the
Government.</p>

<p>``On this issue there is no argument but a small minority decided to
have an occupation to draw attention to it,'' she said.</p>

<p>``But now they're inconveniencing a large group of people who agree
with them rather than protesting to the Government directly.</p>

<p>``If a repossession order is given by the High Court they will
contact the bailiff and the police - the university does not carry out
evictions.''</p>

<p>Janine Booth of the Student's Union executive said the action was
bing taken because of the strength of feeling towards the Government
policy.</p>

<p>She said union members had voted for indefinite occupation but if
steps were taken to remove them there would be ``no form of violent
resistance''.</p>

<p>The university alleges students broke into the hall on Thursday night
but this is disputed by the students although they accept a window has
been broken.</p>
