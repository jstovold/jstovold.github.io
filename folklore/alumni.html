<blockquote>

<h3>Wild Swans Wins Top Book Prize</h3>

<p>The UK's most valuable book prize, the &163;25,000 NCR Book Award,
was won in May by Jung Chang.  The award, sponsored by NCR Ltd, the
computer manufacturer, is the only major prize specially for
non-fiction.</p>

<p>Her book, <em>Wild Swans - Three Daughters of China</em>, previewed
in a feature article in Grapevine 4, beat three others on the shortlist,
<em>Columbus</em> by Filipe Fernandez-Armesto, <em>Bernard Shaw Volume
3</em> by Michael Holroyd, and the Whitbread prize winner, <em>A Life of
Picasso Volume 1</em> by John Richardson.</p>

<p>Jung, a Lecturer at the School of Oriental and African Studies,
became the first student from the People's Republic of China to study in
Britan when she came to York and was awarded a DPil in 1982.  She is
currently working on a biography of Mao.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Take Jack "birch the queers" Straw. He used to be president of the
   National Union of Students. When I was at York University, anyone who
   took student politics seriously was a bit of a joke. York was a
   pretty middle-class establishment, so naturally we were Left-wing. We
   got involved in student politics to get off with girls. All the
   prettiest girls were from boarding school and within a couple of
   months they would have chopped their hair short, joined the Labour
   Club and, with the confidence that only 19-year-old ex-public-school
   girls have, would lay down the political line to all-comers. They
   didn't believe in having steady boyfriends, as this implied being a
   chap's chattel - which was, of course, fascist - so provided one
   learnt a few phrases about women's rights, one could happily bed-hop
   between these gorgeous creatures with impunity.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the Labour Club attracted us like bees round a honey
   pot, and although we were faintly embarrassed to prance around the
   streets of York yelling for higher grants - knowing that the
   Rowntrees workers who cycled past us had wives who sheepishly knocked
   on our bedroom doors at midday to see if we had bothered to get up
   yet so they could clean our rooms - the end of the evening with the
   gorgeous feminist justified the means.</p>
