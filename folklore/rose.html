<p>This article from <i>Vision</i>, November 1993:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The world's largest mechanical rose may soon be seen from your
bedroom window.</p>
<p>A York University graduate has designed a sculpture that could turn out to 
be the centrepiece of campus.</p>
<p>Joseph Sheppard spent months designing the 30 foot mechanical
`Rose of York' and has approached the University's Art Committee to ask
them to approve the design.</p>
<p>The Rose, which he suggests should be located in the lake between
James College and Wentworth, would be the only one of it's kind in the 
country.  He chose the design because ``The University needs a symbol,
something close to York city itself.  The Rose was the obvious choice.''</p>
<p>It has been designed to open and close automatically when water falls
onto it (either by rainfall or a fountain) and it is painted white with
special thermo-sensitive paint, which will turn dark red when the 
temperature falls below freezing.</p>
<p>Joseph is adamant that the design will not cost the University a
penny, as it will be maintenance free.  All the money he needs to build
the Rose will come from charities.  ``The York Common Good Trust has
offered some financial help, but I need more,'' he said.</p>
<p>``It's still a long way from being built, and is only on the
second stage of approval but if it does get built it will take about
six months to complete.''</p>
<p>A lot of research went into the design of the Rose and, where possible,
environmentally-friendly materials will be used in it's construction.  The
paint, for example, has been tested by the University's Chemistry
Department and will not cause pollution by running into the lake.</p>
<p>The Rose will work silently so as not to disturb students and the
structure can hold three times it's own weight, so will stand up to the
rigours of students trying to climb it.</p>
<p>Joseph is no stranger to designing and sculpting.  He has sculptures in 
Prague, Tokyo and the University of California.  He has also sculpted for
the National Children's Home, to help raise money.  The Rose is
just one of his latest projects.</p>
<p>Some students were not impressed by the design, saying it was ``ugly'',
``outrageous'', and ``a bit of an eyesore'', but most thought ``it would
make a nice change'' or ``brighten up the campus''.</p>
<p>However the University's Art Committee Secretary, Philip Simison, 
stated that, ``The idea has not actually been approved by the University,
although we are looking to the future by trying to identify possible
sites for new sculptures.''</p>
