<h2>York Campus Folklore</h2>
<p>Current version rescued from the Wayback Machine by James Stovold on 5th May 2020, this has (clearly) not been updated or maintained for many years.</p>

<h2>My version of Kipper(Now folklore)</h2>
<blockquote>Welcome to the University of York Folklore pages, or at least the version retrieved from kipper.york.ac.uk by Gareth ('Jez') Simkins in 2001, and given to me, Benedict Ibbs, to host.
<p> These pages will, hopefully, provide the backbone for a campus history database which I am currently in the process of developing. ETA for the new version is likely to be end of Summer term 2002, dependent on my time, a smooth, leagal transfer of copyrighted materials, and further submissions. Included in the re-write will be a submissions form, full search facilities and cross-referencing, and a more modern look and feel.
<p> Update 14/4/2002: Robert Gipson, a plant engineer with Yorkshire water, got in touch with me to point ount the inaccuracies in the item about Siwards Tower. Page has been updated. Thanks Robert!

The concrete panels were designed with a life expectancy of 30 years. (This
was in 1963 or so).</dd>

<dt>
<b>U.</b></dt>

<dd>
The University holds a large stockpile of spare concrete panels just in

<dt>

<dd>
In the sixties when the campus was planned, there was a lot of student
political activity - occupying buildings and the like. The lack of large
central facilities at York was meant to stop this happening, Rowntree's
were keen that `their' University would be a quiet place.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>
<a NAME="subuild"></a>Student Union Building</h3>

<dl compact>
<dt>
<b>T.</b></dt>

<dd>
The SU building was converted from a pair of squash courts.</dd>

<dt>
<b>Tb.</b></dt>

<dd>
Due to the inquoracy of UGMs, the SU building wasn't named for more than
a year after completion. One of the proposed names for the SU building
was "Clean Pancake Building". This was supposed to capture the mood of
the students at the time (1994). Students were apathetic and without direction.
"Clean Pancake" is meaningless and was part of a computer generated phrase.
This meaningless captures the apathy of the students.</dd>

<dt>
<b>T.</b></dt>

<dd>
The SU building used to be called the ``Vaseline Building'', named after
the well-known petroleum jelly product. This was voted through a UGM by
members of the Athletics Union. The AU subsequently won &pound;6,000 from
the makers of Vaseline, for ``most original advertising of the year''.
(<b>T.</b> The following year, the AU won the same competition, run by
Halifax, by floating a raft with a big `X' on it down the Ouse, on the
day of the Halifax conversion into a bank. One of the exec. even changed
his name by deed poll from `Antony Gareth Elliott' to `Antony Halifax BUSA
Elliott'.)</dd>

<dt>
<b>T.</b></dt>

<dd>
Is now (1997) called the ``Daw Suu'' Building. Named after a Burmese pro-democracy
activist.</dd>

<dt>
<b>U.</b></dt>

<dd>
The SU building is also referred to as the ``Student Centre'', since it
meant that the signs with abbreviations for Squash Court need not be changed.</dd>

<dd>
Last band to play were the <a href="b-rats.html">Boomtown Rats</a>. The
audience jumping up and down caused structural damage.</dd>

<dt>
<b>T.</b></dt>

<dd>
They did however damage the orchestra pit cover.</dd>

<dt>
<b><a href="b-rats.html">Tb. *</a></b></dt>

<dd>
The Boomtown Rats was an all-seated gig and fire regulations for a seated
gig then prevented dancing, which St. Bob was told. He got people to dance,
and the SU were sued by the University for allowing him to break the regulations.
The SU then sued St. Bob.</dd>

<dt>
<b>Fb.</b></dt>

<dd>
The acoustic tiles on the ceiling are on upside down and therefore absorb
sound rather than reflecting it back in.</dd>

<dt>
<b>Tb.</b></dt>

<dd>
The acoustics were found to be so bad after the place was built, that a
special active speaker system had to be designed and installed. All the
funny tubes hanging from the ceiling are microphones for the system.</dd>

<dt>
<b>Fb.</b></dt>

<dd>
The active speaker system was so far ahead of its time, it is totally crap
and is never used.</dd>

<dt>
<b>T.</b></dt>

<dd>
When the projector was first used (by National Film Theatre), some of the
roof beams blocked the screen.</dd>

Sliding down the hill into the road - look out for the mystery markers
in the pavement outside.</dd>

<dt>
<b>Tb.</b></dt>

<dd>
The cellar under the library used to be a rifle range.</dd>

<dt>
<b>T.</b></dt>

<dd>
Books for the Vanbrugh Rotten Book sale have been kept under the library.</dd>

<dt>
<b>F.</b></dt>

<dd>
Plans for underground car park abandoned at some stage due to weight of
books necessitating stronger foundations. (<b>T.</b> It was found to cost
less to build the library on the hillside.)</dd>

<dt>
<b>Fb.</b></dt>

<dd>
The extension was built onto the back of the library to stop it falling
down the hill.</dd>

<dt>
<b>U.</b></dt>

<dd>
Two students were caught having sex in the microfilm room. (This story
appeared in the campus press apparently, we'll try and track down more).</dd>

<dt>
<b>Tb.</b></dt>

<dd>
Due to the acoustics of the library, even if you fart quietly, it can be
heard clearly.</dd>

<dt>
<b>T.</b></dt>

<dd>
The library snack bar used to be inside the building.</dd>

<dt>
<b>Tb.</b></dt>

<dd>
The snack bar was closed by the then VC because staff and students were
meeting there. (This was during some student unrest). There was such a
fuss they had to build a new one outside - you can see the paving slabs
continue from the outside to the inside.)</dd>
</dl>

<h3>
<a NAME="chemwatertower"></a>Chemistry Water Tower (aka the mushroom)</h3>

<dl compact>
<dt>
<b>Fb.</b></dt>

<dd>
Built without regard for weight of water. Some evidence for this is in
its shape - it looks like there should have been a tall cylinder added
on top of the mushroom of the same diameter at the top bit.</dd>

<dt>
<b>Tb.</b></dt>

<dd>
Is slowly sinking into the ground. (The pipe at the bottom has to be reattatched
every few years.)</dd>

Prof. Heavens has been to the top.</dd>

there, and have some great pictures to prove it.</dd>

<dt>
<b>Fb.</b></dt>

<dd>
Not built high enough, therefore providing insufficient pressure.</dd>

<dt>
<b>U.</b></dt>

<dd>
It is believed that the architect designed this to symbolise the use of
psychedelic mushrooms during the 60s.</dd>

<dt>
<b><a href="watertower.html">Tb. *</a></b></dt>

<dd>
The mushroom can and does hold water and is actually used by the Dept as
a primary source of water.</dd>

<dt>
<b>U.</b></dt>

<dd>
When the mushroom was first floodlit York police were inundated with UFO
sightings.</dd>

<dt>
<b>Tb.</b></dt>

<dd>
Standing underneath it can help cure a hangover.</dd>

<dt>
<b>Tb.</b></dt>

Standing underneath and looking up reminds you of scenes from <i>Independence
Day</i>. (It helps if you're drunk.)</dd>

<h3>
<a NAME="wateronhill"></a>The Water Tower On The Hill</h3>
(the thing that looks like a castle)
<dl compact>
<dt>
<b>F.</b></dt>

<dd>
This is the secret headquarters of the SU/Admin/KGB/etc.</dd>

<dt>
<b>Tb.</b></dt>

The aerials on top of the water tower are believed to be mobile telephone
antennae rather than anything suspicious.</dd>

<dt>

<dt>

The auxiliary supply tank contains 10 million gallons and is actually beneath
the all weather hockey pitch behind Alcuin.</dd>

<dd>
It was a choice between a clock tower for Biology and a swimming pool for
campus - the right choice was obvious.</dd>

<dt>
<b>U.</b></dt>

<dd>
The Biology Clock Tower is in fact a chimney.</dd>

<dt>
<b>Tb.</b></dt>

<dd>
The Biology Clock Tower was designed to hold a water tank for the department.
Somebody donated a clock. Then it was found they didn't need a water tower.
But they still had to build it ...</dd>

The Physics Building cost a million pounds to build.</dd>

<dt>
<b>T.</b></dt>

<dd>
There used to be stepping stones beneath PX001, when the lake went right
up to the side of the building.</dd>

<dt>
<b>T.</b></dt>

<dd>
Colin Johnson inadvertently walked off them while showing prospective undergraduates
round.</dd>

<dt>
<b>T.</b></dt>

<dd>
The stepping stones were filled with land to improve access for the disabled,
at the expense of many a potentially interesting bar-crawl.</dd>

<dt>
<b>F.</b></dt>

<dd>
The sound system inside PX001 was upgraded for minimal cost by FilmSoc
(as they then were) who went round York stealing car stereos. (YSC (as
they now are) don't use them - they belong to admin).</dd>

<dt>
<b>Tb.</b></dt>

<dd>
Many years ago when the roof of the Physics building was leaking, a number
of contractors were contacted for quotes to fix it, and the cheapest was
chosen. They came and worked for a few days and all the leaks stopped.
Several months later, estates needed to do some work in the roofspace,
and discovered lots of dustbins full of water, which the contractor had
put under the holes in the roof, thus ``solving'' the problem.</dd>

<p><br>The final solution involved flooding the roof with tar, having first
covered the rooms below in plastic sheeting to catch drips. This did the
trick, and left behind enough plastic to keep everyone happy for months.</dl>

<dd>
The tower on new psychology building houses a sensory deprivation tank
for experiments.</dd>

<dt>
<b>Fb.</b></dt>

<dd>
The various flags which are flown from the top of the building are part
of a psychology experiment to see how many people go and ask about them.</dd>

<dt>
<b>Fb.</b></dt>

<dd>
There are a number of steel loops set into the outside walls of the building
- these were supposed to be for chaining bikes to. Due to a mix up with
the plans, they are at head-height.</dd>

<dt>
<b>Fb.</b></dt>

<dd>
The steel rings are for attaching guy ropes to in the event of bad weather,
since it has been calculated that strong winds could catch the roof and
lift the entire building into the air.</dd>

<dt>
<b>T.</b></dt>

<dd>
There is a pitch-and-putt course round the back.</dd>

<dl compact>
<dt>
<b>Tb.</b></dt>

<dd>
Sir Jack Lyons had his knighthood removed after the Guinness fraud inquiry
- University declined to remove the building's knighthood on the grounds
that he was still Sir Jack when he donated the money, and when it was built.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>
<a NAME="bleachfield"></a>Bleachfield</h3>

<dd>
Bleachfield is named after Bleachfield Farm, which previously stood on
the Bleachfield -- Music Department site. The area was so-called because
linen bleaching took place on the site. (University News Sheet, April 1991,

There was a fire in biology; water used to put it out drained into the
lake along with lots of nasties.</dd>

<dt>
<b>T.</b></dt>

There was an outbreak of botulism in the mid to late 80s.</dd>

been several bales of hay floating around in the lake each year. These
were said to be intended to improve the quality of the lake water (but

The fountain in the lake is said to add fresh water and oxygen into the
lake water. Unfortunately, nobody has the sense to turn it off when it's
windy. Considering that a fortune must have been spent on building covered
walkways just so students don't get wet when it's raining, someone could
at least make sure that nobody gets soaked when the spray of the fountain
is blown towards dry land or a bridge.</dd>

The sub-aqua club were once asked by the admin to dive in and check the
integrity of the plastic bag that the lake is, but hired an environmental
health officer to check the water first, who pronounced that it would be
dangerous to their health to swim in it.</dd>

After the murder of an open university lecturer, police frogmen spent several

Curse on James Wentworth Bridge - not long after its construction a particularly

The bridge connecting the library with the spiral is crumbling. Some people
have seen bits falling off it. In fact the concrete of the Library-Spiral
bridge is showing signs of deformation and buckling due to the pressure
of the Library sliding down the hill towards the lake. After rain, water
pours through hairline cracks caused by the buckling, down onto cars passing
underneath (and people standing at the bus stop).</dd>

One of the concrete bridges on campus will have to be replaced soon. (The
development review of 1985 said `within 10 years'. This is because the
concrete has been attacked by use of chlorides. The cost was thought to
be about &pound;250,000, so the library bridge is probably the most likely.)</dd>

When compsci got their new HLH Orion computers in '88, there was a couple
of serious bugs in the system. The first meant that terminals would `die'
when you logged out, and couldn't be used to log back in; vuft would fill
up with turned-over keyboards indicating the dead terminal. forsyth produced
a staff-owned setuid root program called clearline that mucked around in
the kernel to clear up this problem. The suns had passwordless login called
``console'' that had staff privs, so it was possible to set up a sgid-staff
shell purely for running clearline and making things usable again.</dd>

<dt>
<b>Tb.</b></dt>

<dd>
The other, <b>much</b> more interesting bug was that at random, processes
would flip into root. this lead to numerous people with files they couldn't
write to, etc., and, after one user noticed her prompt had changed to a
funny # character, a long battle between numerous students
to hide root
hacks that they could reinvoke, but that other students couldn't. Forsyth
found this out, and cleaned up almost all the hacks. one remained in until
the orions were dumped. it didn't fire until most of the students responsible
had left.</dd>

A ``.paranoia virus'' was put into /lib/crt0.o, the file that gets linked
into every compiled C program, and is the code that actually calls main().
it wasn't a virus actually - more of a trojan.</dd>

<p><br>It checked the current process id (using a direct system call trap,
to avoid invoking any other library functions); if (pid % 256) == 42 then
it would create a file in the current directory called ``.paranoia'' with
no contents and no permissions to do anything on it. The character codes
for the string ``.paranoia'' were hidden in a series of adds and shifts
in the code adding to the difficulty of the detection.
<p>This meant that from the moment it was installed, newly compiled programs
occasionally hatched a .paranoia file... including for example ``glide'',
the functional language interpreter provided by the department, and eventually
most of the compilers.
<p>The trojan even managed to propagate from Orion2 to Orion1.

The way into the student machines in those days was quite elegant. After
popping root on the Orion, one student made /etc/rc.local writable on <b>one</b>
of the disc-less student sun workstations. So, if anything needed ``doing'',
the extra commands were written into that file, which runs as root on bootup,
and a command inserted to copy the original version of the file back over
it -- hence, nobody ever logged in as root.</dd>

<p><br>Since there was no change to the content of any of the system files,
only a one-bit change in the permissions on one file, this remained in
place for ages and ages -- a very thorough check of the boot partition
on the Suns eventually revealed what had happened

properly'', ``ask nicely'', ``where's your glass, I just gave you one not
more than 20 minutes ago, no you can't have a clean one'' etc.etc.etc,
all the oldies have their favourite stories) and at drinking up time (standing
on stools and banging trays next to your head to get you to leave). This

When a fire alarm in (the detached) Vanbrugh X block went off, it triggered
the fire alarms in the rest of Vanbrugh (and vice versa). So for example,
when someone sneezed in V/X block, they warned the rest of Vanbrugh too
just in case the sneeze triggers off a chain-reaction taking out the rest
of Vanbrugh. You can tell the difference between an alarm in your block
and a block that is detached from you by the difference in beeps. The first
is continuous beeps, and the latter is intermittent beeps. The Vanbrugh
fire alarms are no longer linked in this way.</dd>

In 1991-1992, the railings on Vanbrugh Bar didn't completely shut off the
bar, and it was possible to put an arm through a gap and pull yourself
a pint (presumably, the gap may have been wider than a pint glass, or a
hosepipe was used). After the place was cleaned up at midnight, a small
number of students would sneak back in and give themselves free drinks

Until the summer 1989 (or was it 1988?) revamp, Goodricke bar contained
the `famous' Goodricke Table. This was a wooden table with various college
graffiti, famous names and so on, which resided at the lakeward end of
the bar area (which was not as large as it is now). In 1989, in revenge
for events unknown, a party of students from another college kidnapped
said table and it went out of circulation for a while. It was rediscovered
some weeks later on the top floor of Alcuin A-Block. This discovery may
have been in some way related to the flooding of Alcuin (see <a href="#alcuin">above</a>)</dd>

<dd>
Another version is that The Goodricke Table was nicked to ``save'' it during
the impending revamping of the bar (the old bar was a much more dingy and
messy place; much better, too). anyway, it was hidden on top of the block
to keep it safe, but after all that time, it was found to have warped considerably,
It was generally accepted that they should have just chopped the legs off
it, and nailed it to the wall.</dd>

There used to be a sad case of a student who was totally out of touch with
reality, spent all her time at university MUDding on the computers, going
beserk in the terminal rooms (usually the Derwent SGI room) and screaming
her head off at the furniture. People often found it amusing to log her
off and watch her go mental.</dd>

Until the early 90s there was a Computer Society on campus. Although not
as popular as it had been in the late 70s this still ran trips, social
events and the odd talk up to about 1990. It is fair to say that the society
moved from being something the CS department liked to something it rather
preferred to ignore. It was best known for drunkenness, and for ``Tabloid
Teletype'', a fairly scurrilous magazine mixing local satire, net humour
and similar. This was originally lineprinter output, though Pete Fenelon
took it to laser-printed format (plain ASCII text) in '87 and to typeset
format in '89. Some of the later issues (1990-1) were A5, had proper card
covers and rather handsome, but by that time there were less and less original
articles!</dd>

URY was not actually broadcast in the conventional sense, but was cabled
around campus. To pick it up properly, you had to be in one of the buildings
which has been fitted with an induction loop around the top, which carries
the signal. (The same principle is used to transmit to hearing aids in
public rooms.) The loop directs the signal down into the building, and
also up to the ionosphere, from where it bounced down to other countries.
Goodricke A and B blocks are different - the signal cable was connected
to the metal structure of the building!)</dd>
