Siward's Howe Water Tower</h1>

<p>The water tower on Siward's Howe (the thing that looks like a castle)
has been there since 1955.  It was built to serve the rapidly expanding
population of York at that time.  The Fine Arts Commission had a say
in the design, following a great deal of controversy, and the original
builders were bankrupted by the work which had to be completed by another
firm.  The tower held one million gallons of water and was the largest
elevated tank in the country when built. In 1977 a ten million gallon
covered reservoir was constructed alongside it to supplement the supply.

<p>The tower is no longer used for water, as <a href="mailto:pjs103@york.ac.uk">
Pete Simpson</a> tells us:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can enlighten you further on Siwards Howe: I've actually been inside.</p>

<p>At the moment, it does not contain any water - all of the machinery
which used to be responsible for pumping the water has been partially
dismantled and fell into disrepair years ago. It was made obsolete a
good while back (no exact date, I'm afraid) and it is now used as a
storage facitily for Yorkshire Water's hardware (spare pipes, digging
equipment, etc.)</p>

<p>I found this out in the summer of 1995 when I noticed a lot of activity
going on and managed to persuade the site manager to let me have a quick
peek inside. I wish I'd had my camera with me!</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>
14/4/2002. Robert Gipson got in touch with the following:
<blockquote>
<p>"I can put you to rights regarding Siwards How water tower.
As a plant engineer working for Yorkshire water and with 27 years service
with the previous York Water Works Co, I should know a thing or to.
<p>
True, it looks more like a castle.
<p>But unless there is a larger one constructed in the last few years
 I do still believe it is the largest water tower in europe.
The water is held in the tank at the top...... 1,000,000 galls
or 4.5 million Ltrs when full.
And has been in use since it was constructed in 1956 ( I think ).
The water is held at the high level to give a large area of York the
pressure
they are used to.<p>
It is true that the area below the tank is used for storage.
It is amazing how much we can store in that area!
<p>I do believe the name "Siwards how" has originated from one of the Roman
bosses that controlled our area and that How means mound. It is certainly on
a high spot.!
The roman connection is hearsay. I have not seen anything in print regarding
it.<p>
Someone once mentioned that three workers died building it, but once again I
have not seen proof.
It is certainly a spooky place in the dead of night!
<p>Enough for now.
<p>Must get the facts right"</blockquote>
<p>And then again, after further research, Robert uncovered this:
<blockquote>
Siward , d. 1055, earl of Northumbria. A Danish warrior, he probably came to
England with King Canute. At the behest of King Harthacanute in 1041 he
ravaged Worcestershire and perhaps murdered Eadwulf of Northumbria;
thereafter he was himself earl of Northumbria. He supported Edward the
Confessor against Earl Godwin in 1051 and in 1054 defeated Macbeth, king of
Scotland, on behalf of Siward's nephew, later Malcolm III.
<p>
It appears I may be wrong re: the Roman connection. Them I`m no histrorian !
If he is the one, then I am wondering what the connection is to Siwards How
near the uni !
