Chemistry Lecturer / Physics Lecturer / School Teacher Murders Wife</h1>

The murder was committed by Ian Smith, who worked for
the Physics and Education departments, teaching the Physics--Education
MSc.<p>

Apparently he made up some elaborate story to the Chemistry stores as to
why he needed a canister of carbon monoxide.  He then cycled
to his caravan at Appleton Roebuck, where he asphixiated his wife using the gas.  He took
a large dose himself to add to the credibility of his story, which was that
the gas fire in the van was to blame.  He then cycled back to Chemistry and
returned the cylinder to stores.<p>

The forensic team spotted however that the amount of carbon monoxide produced
by the fire could in no way explain quantity the wife had received.<p>

Ian Smith was convicted of the crime, but due to extenuating circumstances
(we don't really know what these were) received only a three year sentence;
of which he served about one.<p>

He has now remarried and works as a school teacher somewhere in the South-West.
(A pupil of his recently came to Physics for an interview and returned a book Smith
had borrowed before the murder).<p>

A senior member of the Physics department said of Smith ``We didn't
think he could organise a piss up in a brewery'', but the murder was
apparently very well planned and in the end he did only serve one year.<p>

A BBC television program was later made about the crime, and is available
on video.<p>
