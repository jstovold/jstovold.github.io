Tory Porn Shock</h1>

On 18 August 1996, someone changed the content of the University Conservative
Society's web pages.
This appeared in the Times, and possibly a few other papers.  The
Times article also appeared in
<a href="http://www.the-times.co.uk/news/pages/tim/96/08/19/timnwsnws01019.html?1111111">the online Times Newspaper</a>.
This article hot off the press from the Week 0 issue of <i>Vision</i>
 (October 1996):

<blockquote>

<p>THE UNIVERSITY is continuing its investigation into the placing of
obscene remarks and pornographic images on York University's
Conservative and Unionist Association's official web page over the
summer.</p>

<p>The offensive material was broadcast worldwide under the
Conservative logo until Computer Services at the University became
aware of the situation and immediately blocked the pages. The culprit
substituted pictures of Margaret Thatcher and Michael Portillo with
those of naked females and gay porn under such captions as "John
Major's Favourite Pictures". Accounts of society meetings were altered
to include calls from Mussolini and Hitler, while details of the
associations trip to the London conference were tampered with to
suggest members visited sex shops and prostitutes.</p>

<p>The University has ascertained that the alterations, which made the
front page of the Sport and appeared in major newspapers such as the
Times, occurred in the early hours of the morning on two terminals in
Goodricke computer room.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the university, commented that Computer Services
were also sure that these changes were not done by a "hacker" but by
someone who had in some way acquired the password which is needed to
alter a home-page. Although it is further assumed that it is not a
member of the campus tory party itself as the comments were so
detrimental to the society.</p>

<p>Hilary Layton, at the University's Press and Publicity office, was
anxious to point out that such offences do not only contravene the
university's policy, but are also against the law and that staff and
students can be prosecuted for broadcasting such material on the
internet.</p>

<p>Matthew Stallabrass, campus conservative chair, was summoned to
Conservative Central Office in London as a result of the prank.</p>

<p>John Purle, chair 1994/5, commented: "the story made it into more
than one newspaper...it must have been press released and so was
probably a pre-meditated job with a political motive."</p>

<p>He further defended the society against accusations that security
was lax, in light of the fact that the password had not been updated
since March stating: "members have the password, as do their friends
and so on.  The campus conservatives are not a clique - we are an open
society."</p>

<p>The associations web-pages have previously come under fire for their
content which has been accused of being homophonic and sexist but these
allegations have been fiercely denied and are not in any way connected
with the current incident.</p>
