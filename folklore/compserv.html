York Computer History </h1>

<p>(As you can see there are a lot of gaps in the early history here.  If
anyone has more details we would be glad to hear them.)</p>

<h2>1966</h2>

<dl>
<dt>	Summer
<dd>	<a href="computation.html">York's first computer</a>
	delivered: an Elliott Automations machine.  Programs can be written in
	Algol, Fortran or Neat (the assembly language for 4100 computers).
</dl>

<h2>1969</h2>

<dl>
<dd>	New computer delivered - ICL 1900 - with
	punch cards, paper-tape &amp; genuine (magnetic) core memory. 
	Charles Stanley-Smith ran his final year project to model
	Fluro Cyanide (FCN) on it.  It took 7
	hours to run and came up with the answer of 42 (Angstroms).
<dd>	Programming in Algol &amp; Fortran, was achieved by writing programs on
	special sheets (Pink for Algol and Blue for Fortran) and submitting them,
	results (usually compile errors) were returned 24 hours later. Backups
	were another shoe box full of punch cards.
<dd>	There was also a connection to Leeds, where they had a ICL 2900.
</dl>

<h2>1972</h2>

<dl>
<dd>	PDP-11 bought as front-end to the increasingly creaky ICL 4130
	and give online access to
	strategic points around campus. They ran something called the Kent
	Online System or KOS.
</dl>

<h2>1976</h2>

<dl>
<dd>	ICL 1900 pensioned off.
<dd>	DEC KL10A arrived, was dropped during unloading, and
	promptly reloaded and shipped back to DEC.  A second one arrived
	and took, as expected, far longer to install than had been allowed.
	A new wing of the Comp. Center was built to accomodate the new
	system. It generated so much heat that the air conditioning spewed
	clouds of steam out of the vents on the University Road side of the
	building.

<h1><a name="details">Computer Details</a></h1>

<h2><a name="dec">DECsystems</a></h2>

<p>Introduced in about 1972, later on there were two - a KS10 and a KL10.
The KS10 was apparently largely used by computer science, the KL by
the rest of the university.</p>

<h2><a name="vax">VAX</a></h2>

The first incarnation of the VAX at York was a two-processor
cluster, as reported in the University News Sheet Issue 190 (October 1986):
<blockquote>
<p><strong>VAX cluster for York</strong></p>

<p> The University has just replaced its DEC KL1090 computer system with a 
VAX cluster.  Initially the cluster consists of two processors:
an 8650 with 32 Mbytes of memory, and an 8200 with 8 Mbytes.  They
run the VAX/VMS operating system and support 120 users.  The processors
share disk and tape storage.  There are two tape drives and twelve
Winchester disks with a total capacity of 6 Gbytes.  Printing 
facilities consist of a line printer and a laser printer.  There
are no card or paper tape facilities on the system.</p>

<p> Fortran, Pascal, Basic, Simula, Cobol, C, and Ada are the languages
supported, and about 20 packages and libraries are available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The tape drives were 6250/1600
bpi units.  The line printer could churn out 600 lines per minute, the laser
printer a respectable 12 pages per minute.
Operating system was originally VMS 4.4(?), upgraded to 5.1-1 in 1989,
then to 5.2 and 5.3 in 1990, and 5.4 in 1991. </p>

<p>The two computers were called <tt>VAXA</tt> (the 8650) and
<tt>VAXB</tt> (the 8200).  This original VAXB couldn't cope with the
load and was replaced by an 8550 within a year.  From autumn 1988,
users could just type `<tt>CALL VAX</tt>' and were automatically connected
to the one with the lowest load.</p>

<p>TCP/IP (in the form of UCX) arrived on the Vax systems only after the
installation of Unix systems in the computing service and the threat or
promise of JIPS.</p>

<p>The two VAXen were removed in Summer 1993, but were replaced by a 
single machine, <tt>vax</tt>.  It is a Microvax 3100 model 90, about
four times more powerful than each of the old two.  The old magnetic tape
drive was not attatched to the new VAX, as use of such tapes was
being phased out.</p>

<p>Readers of late-1980 era <i>Keynotes</i> may remember the cartoon
strip featuring the two VAXen talking to each other.  Below are a few
excerpts:</p>
<dl compact>
<dt>``This isn't why I became a VAX... I wanted to work for NASA''
</dl>
<dl compact>
<dt>	VAXA
<dd>	What's 2 + 2?''
<dt>	VAXB
<dd>	``I don't know, you're the clever one.''
</dl>

<p>What do all the letters mean?  Here's a guide from the March 1990
<i>Keynotes</i>:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt>	VAX
<dd>	Virtual Architecture Extension.  The type of computer used by the 
	Computing Service.  So called because it was developed as as
	`extension' to an older and simpler design of computer.
<dt>	VMS
<dd>	Virtual Memory System.  The Operating System that runs on the VAX computer
	and gives it its particular personality.  VAXes can also run other
	operaing systems, such as UNIX.
<dt>	DEC
<dd>	Digital Equipment Corporation.  Also known as `Digital'.  Manufacturers
	of the VAX computer and the VMS operating system.
<dt>	DCL
<dd>	Digital Command Language.  The normal user interface to the VMS operating
	system.  Also known as a `command interpreter'.  This is the language
	you use to give commands to the VAX to list directories, run
	programs etc.  The familiar $ prompt is a sign that the system is
	waiting for a DCL command to execute.  Some other command interpreters
	exist - for example SHELL, which allows Unix-like commands to be
	given instead of DCL.
</dl>

<p>Notable locally-developed VAX software included the BBS system 
<strong>Jorvick</strong>, a
Bullet-III lookalike, though unlike BBS systems elsewhere this was never
really intended for outside access.  Sadly, Jorvick was never
rewritten to run on tower, and some of the functionality has been taken over
by the newsgroups.  There have also been a couple of attempts in the late 90s
to start a <a href="http://kipper.york.ac.uk/moo/">Campus Moo</a>, a multi-user
realtime world based
on the University (like a mud without the fighting).  This never took off,
although we still have the database...</p>

<h2><a name="word">WORD</a></h2>

<p>VMS Wordperfect System, introduced in 1990 to take the load off of the 
VAXcluster which was running WPS+.  At first the system was WordPerfect 5.0 running
on 3 MicroVAX 3100 computers,
called <tt>WORDA</tt>, <tt>WORDB</tt> and <tt>WORDC</tt>.  As with the
VAXcluster, users could type
`<tt>CALL WORD</tt>' and were connected to the one with the lowest load.
The software was upgraded to WordPerfect V5.1-1 in April 1992.</p>

<p>Along with the replacement of the VAX cluster in 1993, the WORD cluster
was also updated to a single, more powerful unit.</p>

<h2><a name="tower">tower</a></h2>

<p>Silicon Graphics Challenge system.  64 Mb memory, increased to 96 Mb 1992.
</p>

<p>When delivered, had four 33 MHz processors.  Upgraded to eight in 1994
by adding four 44 MHz processors.  At the same time, the memory was 
doubled to 192 Mb.</p>

Replaced in 1994(?) by a newer machine, called for a while <tt>newtower</tt>
4x 200-MHz processors.</p>

<p>Replaced again in 1998, by a Sun Ultra10.  500 Mb memory, but only one 
processor. (Fortunately, the similarly-specced mailer took most of the load
from tower).</p>

<h2><a name="ebor">ebor</a></h2>

<p>Delivered and installed circa July 1994.
Silicon Graphics 8x 150-MHz processor Challenge Deskside system.</p>

<p>Replaced in 1998 by a Sun Enterprise 3500, 6 processors at 366 MHz and
1 Gb memory.</p>

<h2><a name="goodram">goodram</a></h2>

<p>Auspex NS6000 file server, purchased late 1993.  Central SUN-4 host
processor, with NFS traffic handled by microprocessor modules
interconnected by an Enhanced VMEbus backplane operating at 55MByte/s.
These are a File processor, an Ethernet Processor, an FDDI processor,
and the Storage processor.  There is also an io cache.  The Storage
processor can handle 20 SCSI devices.  When delivered goodram had one
FDDI processor and one Ethernet processor, and 12Gb of disk space in 3Gb
disks.  This was upgraded to 15Gb at the start of 1994.</p>

<h2><a name="pump">pump1, pump2</a></h2>

<p>Sun Ultrasparc 2200 servers, introduced in October 1997 to handle
news and mail respectively.</p>

<h2><a name="crypt">crypt1, crypt2, crypt3</a></h2>

<p>Network Appliance filers, the first 2 installed October 1997.  Disk capacities were
36 Gb and 72 Gb respectively.</p>

<p>Upgraded and joined by a third in summer 1999, now F740 models.  Total
space 160Gb.</p>
