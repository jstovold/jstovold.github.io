From the University <i>News Sheet</i> Issue 190 (October 1986):
<blockquote>
<strong>Knighthood for University Architect</strong><br>
Andrew Derbyshire of Messrs Robert Matthew, Johnson-Marshall and
Partners, the University architects, has received a knighthood
in the recent Queen's Birthday Honours list.
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="concrete">Concrete buildings</a></h2>

<p>One of the most noticeable features of the York Campus is the way all the
original buildings are made of prefabricated slabs of concrete.  The
building design is known as C.L.A.S.P., and was specially developed
for the York Campus.</p>

<p>Two main reasons have been given for adopting the prefabricated
building style at York.  Firstly, the campus was to be built as quickly
as possible.  (The University was only founded in 1963, yet the first
students started in 1964, with building work still going strong.)
Secondly, there was not a large skilled labour force available in York
to build a conventional style of building.  It was calculated that building
the University would need some 700 men, about 20% of the York
labour force at the time.  (There was also apparently a national shortage
of bricks in the early 60's, and it is possible that shallower foundations
are needed with CLASP - worth considering since the ground is very marshy.)</p>

<p>The CLASP system was first developed by local authorities who needed to
build school buildings as quickly and cheaply as possible.  The first
building in York to be built using CLASP was the <a href="#new">`New'
building</a> in Heslington Village.  This had wooden cladding of the
external walls.</p>

<p>CLASP (Consortium of Local Authorities' Special Programme) was based on a
steel frame with cladding panels, and flat roofs.  The design allowed
production of components that could quickly be erected on site, whilst enabling
flexibility of design, and changes during the lifetime of the building.</p>

<p>Before any major building work was done, the design of the system was
improved.  The main difference is the use of prefabricated concrete
cladding panels, which significantly increased the durability and
fire-resistance of the design.  Contrary to campus folklore, there is no
life expectancy of the panels, and they have been found to
be relatively cheap to maintain and easily adaptable over the past 30 years.
Properly maintained, the buildings should last as long as any other.  It would
have been possible to make the concrete panels in different colours to add
variety, but
it was cheaper and quicker to have them all the same.</p>

<p>There are a number of stages of development of the CLASP system in the
University.  Derwent, Langwith and Chemistry are built from Mark III; Alcuin
and Vanbrugh from Mark IIIb; Goodricke and Biology from Mark IV; and Wentworth
(1970) from Mark V.</p>

<p>Although visually similar to the rest of the old colleges, parts of
Wentworth college is built using conventional methods, with load-bearing
internal walls.  This is because at the time these parts were built (1975), there
was not enough money to build it using the more flexible CLASP
methods.</p>

<p>Since the late 70's, buildings have been constructed of more traditional
materials.  (Individual items such as Central Hall and the Concert Hall
have also had their own designs.)  By the Development Review in 1985, only
55% of buildings on campus were built of CLASP materials.</p>

<p>Sources: <i>Nouse</i> Issue 10 (Thur 28th Oct 1965),
University Development Plan, University Development Plan Review.</p>

<p>There's a book on CLASP in King's Manor Library, but it covers later
development techniques than those used at York.</p>

<h2><a name="new">The `New' Building</a></h2>

<p>The `New' Building (yes, that is how it is written on the sign outside)
is in Heslington Village, just before you get to the Charles when coming
from campus.  It was the first building to be built for the University,
dating from 1962 (?).  It was needed to supplement the only other
teaching accomodation on campus, the converted Heslington Hall, which did
not contain any large rooms suitable for lectures.  The `New' Building was
built from the original prefabricated CLASP system, and was erected in
just 5 months.</p>

<p>The `New' Building is now home to the Norwegian Studies Institute.</p>

<p>For a while before the existence of the Science Park, this building
effectively served some of the same functions as the innovation centre - a
number of high-tech startup companies, mostly spinoffs from the university,
were based there including York Software Engineering, Hand Whittington and
Associates and HCI.</p>


<h2><a name="central">Central Hall</a></h2>

<p>I think the best thing to do here is quote from <i>Nouse</i> No. 18
(Thursday, 23rd June 1966):
<blockquote>
<p><b>Central Hall Plans Finalised</b>

<p>Plan for the Central Hall have now been finalised and were recently
open to inspection.  The hall, which should be open by the end of
1968, is planned as being one of the focal points of the university
and for this reason its site will be at the centre of the colleges,
when they are completed.  Its position between college five and Langwith
will be on a promontory position jutting into the lake , it will then
be artificially surrounded by the lake by the formation of a pool
behind the building.

<p>The hall is to be used for such functions as dances, ballet, and theatre
productions, although preference is to be given to lectures and to
examinations.  It is already tentatively booked for five or six conferences.

<p>Architecturally, the exterior of the building has what might be described
as a strong nautical flavour, as it does not look unlike the superstructure
of an aircraft carrier, made of concrete.  The roof of the building is
to be made of copper or aluminum (depending on the current price of
copper) and there is to be a `spire' which will be held to the
roof by guy ropes, these being partially to hold the structure together.
There are to be balconies and paved ways around the building overlooking
the lake.

<p>The foyer is to be built underneath the main stage area and it will
additionally be used as an exhibition space.  A rehearsal room, lecture
theatre, debating chamber and robing room are also to be added.  The full
capacity of the hall will be 1,250, although by a system of
curtaining the size may be reduced, so that the tiering around the
sides may be screened off.
</blockquote>

The list of rooms to be added at the bottom is quite impressive and would
take up as much room as the hall itself.  As far as we know none of these
were built, has anyone been backstage?<p>

The article was accompanied by photos of the architect's model of the
completed building, which as far as we can tell is <em>exactly</em>how
it was built.<p>

The acoustics have always been described as `dry' because of it's
intended uses, and some experiments have been made to improve them.  
An artificial resonance system was installed, the same design was used in
the Festival Hall in London - the tubes hanging from the gantries above the
audience are Helmholtz resonators.  More recently, the Arts Council funded the
installation of a canopy over the stage with a reflector incorporated - sadly it
is not really in the right place as it would block the projector, and a movable
reflector was too expensive.<p>

<h2><a name="library">Library</a></h2>

<p>The J B Morrell library is named after a founding father of the
University, John Bowes Morrell.</p>

<p>The original campus development plan was hoping for a more impressive
building than the one that was built - constructed on a terrace projecting from
the hillside over a large car park on two levels, including various social
facilities.  The building would have formed a bridge over University Road.</p>

<p>The library was built as part of Phase 3 of the original university
development plan, and was completed in June 1966.  The structure is precast
concrete.
The library was extended in 1987 at the back, providing more
space for books and students.  A further extension is now (1999) being planned.
</p>

<p>The internal design has been criticised since it was built.  The
open staircase in the middle, together with the use of hard materials such
as ceramic tiles, makes the library a noisy place in which to work.
When first built the issues desk was on the first floor, directly above
it's current position.  This created so much noise that a canopy
had to be provided above it, which is still there.</p>

<p>The roof of the original building was replaced in 1992/3 due
to disintegration of the original asphalt and chipboard flat roof.</p>

<h3><a name="bookshop">Bookshop</a></h3>

<p>From 1966, Godfrey's had a small shop within the library.
The current bookshop was built by them in 1978.  The sign on the library
pointing to Godfrey's lasted many years after the shop was changed to
Blackwells.</p>

<h2><a name="physics">Physics</a></h2>

<p>The Physics building is one of the more prominent buildings on campus,
and unfortunately is also one of the most ugly.  
Once again, a quote from <i>Nouse</i>, this time Thurs, May 11 1967:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Million Pound Fun Palace for Physicists</strong></p>

<p>By November of this year York's physicists will have moved from the
temporary home in the chemistry laboratories and into their own labs.
across the lake from the central hall.  The new buildings, costing
nearly a million pounds, have been built with full consultation between
the architects and Prof O S Heavens, the head of the physics department.

<p>Great efforts have been made to produce a versatile building; none of the
internal walls support the roof, so if a larger area of space is needed
it can be obtained by knocking down a few walls.  The research wings can
be extended by simply removing the clasp walls and building outwards.

<p>The presence of vibration in the chemistry labs, makes them far from
ideal for physics, which often involves highly sensitive apparatus.  In
the new labs the effects of vibration have been considerably reduced by
building the research wings on foundations of solid concrete.  The
machine shop is built on a raft of concrete set in cork to prevent the
transmission of vibrations to other parts of the building.  Specially
sensitive instruments will be mounted on concrete pillars set deep into
the earth.

<p>One of the wings will be air-conditioned; this air-conditioning being
part of a Helium recovery plant.  Any helium vapour which enters the air
in this wing will be collected by the air-conditioning.  The cost of
the plant will be covered over time because although the amount of
helium in the atmosphere is minute, it is a highly expensive gas.
&#163;20000 has gone towards the building of a room lined with copper.  This
copper provides a shield from stray electric fields such as radio waves.

<p>The last job of the contractors will be to cut away the arch from the
front of the building, which will leave the flying wing lecture theatre
jutting dramatically out over the lake.
</blockquote>

<p>As far as is known, the helium plant was never built
(<a href="mailto:mapj1@york.ac.uk">Mike Page-Jones</a> reports that
it did exist, but was shutdown sometime after the electronics departments'
creation (ie late 70's) due to tightening of safety regulations -- It'd
be nice to hear this from someone that was around at the time).</p>

<p>The Physics Department Newsheet 4, 29 March 1984 has this short
article</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>The Name Game</strong></p>

<p>The Physics building is now shared by two departments and, in some
ways, it is unfortunate for our Electronics colleagues that they are in
the <strong>Electronics Department</strong> in the
<strong>Physics</strong> building. The situation can be made better for
them, and prehaps a little more interesting for us, if the building had
a name so that, for example, the Departments of Electronics and Physics
were situated in the ``X building'' where X was some suitable name.</p>

<p>If a suitable name can be found then it could be submitted to the
Vice-Chancellor and/or Council for approval.  I invite members of both
departments to submit suggestions for a name to me by the end of April
1984.  A small committee will then be set up, with representatives of
both departments, to select the most appropriate name from those
submitted.  For the person suggesting this name, whether or not it is
finally approved, there will be a prize of a bottle of whiskey.</p>

<p align=right>Prof Woolfson</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The official name of the Physics building changed to the
Physics and Electronics Building in 1986.</p>

<p>Some extensions have been made to the sides of the building, notably
the Electronics Workshop during 1996.  An even cheaper way of doing this
is to add Portakabins to the outside.  Also today (3/9/96) workmen are
busy knocking a wall down inside, to make one room into two.</p>

<p>In 1993 the concourse area was extended by the Conference Office.  The
following item appeared in the <i>News Sheet</i> (December 1992):</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Waterfront exhibition area planned</strong></p>

<p>The University's lack of a large indoor space for major exhibitions is
set to end with a new extension to the concourse area in the Physics and
Electronics Building.  The single storey extension will extend the
perimeter of the existing concourse and P/X001, P/L001 and P/L002 and
moving it nearer the lake.  This will increase the concourse's current
gross area of 500 square metres to 900 square metres.</p>

<p>Many conference organisers hold exhibitions as part of their
programme.  The new concourse will mean that the University may
attract new conference clients and also that the marquees and
pavillions erected from time to time over the summer should become a
thing of the past.  There will be room for 60 to 65 stands in
the new concourse but flexible screening means that the area will
have the potential to become several exhibition areas or a mixture
of teaching and exhibition rooms.</p>

<p>During term time the new extension will result in three new
teaching spaces: a computing area for the Electronics Department and
two centrally timetabled rooms for teaching; and a reception and
lounge area for departments.</p>

<p>The plans also incorporate a number of other features: a larger,
permanent home for the Vickers Collection; a seminar room; the
replacement of the snack bar by vending machines under the
main staircase; improvements to the entrance from Goodricke College;
a public address system for conference visitors; the enlargement of
the Porters' Lodge; additional card and cash telephones;
enlargements to the Senior Common Room; the filling-in of the
stepping stones across the lake to allow wheelchair access; the
probability of a glazed screen around the first floor mezzanine which
will reduce noise and smoke levels.</p>

<p>Work will begin on the extension in June 1993 and is is expected
to be finished by the end of the summer vacation.  During the summer
temporary footpaths will be laid from Central Hall and Goodricke College
to the teaching block of the Physics/Electronics building.  In the
meantime enquiries about the extension should be directed to the
following people: Alan Strong (computer classroom/mezzanine/common
room); John Nash (two teaching rooms); Roy Whitaker (catering);
Harry Milner (Porters' Lodge); Richard Hainsworth (exhibition space).</p>

<p>Architects' plans giving detailed information on the extension are
currently on display in the Physics/Electronics building.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The extension work included the enlargement of the Senior Common Room;
enclosure of the first floor mezzanine; modification of the Ladies
toilets; adding wooden panels to the central staircase; and putting a new
fire exit staircase to P/X001.

<p>The concourse was opened on 4th October 1993 by the Chancellor, Dame
Janet Baker.</p>

<p>In 1998, plans are afoot for the University to remove the central stairs and
fill in the mezzanine to 
provide office and lab space.  This will enable the conference office to make
more use of the room currently used as the Electronics computer room.</p>

<h2><a name="obs">Observatory</a></h2>

<p>The Department of Physics observatory is in the middle of a field
behind the sports centre.  The grand opening was reported in the
November 1993 <i>University Magazine</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Chancellor opens the Observatory...</strong></p>
<p>The day was wet and windy, the ground a muddy bog, but the occasion
was a happy celebration of success.  Protected by wooden pallets underfoot
and armed with comforting mulled wine, guests of the Physics Department
joined the Chancellor and the Astronomer Royal, Professor Arnold
Wolfendale, in the opening of the University's Observatory on 2 December.</p>

<p>The small neat building is deceptive.  It has two storeys, a revolving roof
and a 14 inch Schmidt-Cassegrain reflecting telescope mounted on a
massive equatorial fork mounting.  This observatory has been built to
professional standards and will enable Physics students and staff to carry
out astronomical teaching and research.</p>

<p>The Astronomer Royal praised the Observatory and commented on the success
of Astronomy in the north of England over the centuries, including that
of John Goodricke.  ``Some of our ideas are right too, aren't they
Michael?'' he said to Professor Michael Woolfson.  They both shook their
heads.</p>

<p>The Chancellor expressed thanks to the many local firms, including
Ibstock Brick Ltd, Bovis Construction Ltd, William Birch and Sons Ltd
and Whitby Oliver and Sons Ltd, for the gift of materials and
labour for the Observatory.</p>

<p>That done, guests had the chance to see through the telescope for
themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The top dome of the observatory is floating on a water tank, to allow
it to be turned round easily.  There is no heating in the dome, since
the rising hot air could distort the telescope's view.</p>

<h2><a name="electronics">Electronics</a></h2>

The new electronics building, next to the car park, was built in 1987/8.
The following article appeared in the University <i>News Sheet</i>, Issue 195
(June 1987):
<blockquote>
<strong>New Building for Electronics</strong>
<p>This autumn the Department of Electronics will be increasing its
annual intake of undergraduates from 45 to 70, and there will be
a corresponding increase in the number of staff.  New undergraduate courses
are bwing planned in Avionics and in Physical Electronics, the latter
in conjunction with the Department of Physics.</p>

<p>Since this expansioino cannot be accomodated in the present Physics
and Electronics Building, a new building is about to be constructed
alongside it, as shown in the diagram. [This may follow later. www]
Most of the space in this new building will be occupied by the
following three Electronics groups which need facilities that cannot
be provided satisfactorily in the old building and which now have
laboratories specially designed for them:</p>
<ol>
<li>the Microelectronic Devices Research Group, which will have a
	clean room for fabricating micro-electronic devices;
<li>the Electromagnetic Compatibility Group, which will have a
	screened room for research on electrical interference; and
<li>the Electronics Centre, which undertakes design and development
	work for industrial firms, particularly in the York area.
</ol>
<p>Moving the three groups into the new building will free space in the old
building to accomodate the additional undergraduates and staff, and to
allow some expansion of other research groups.  The self-financing
Electronics Centre will be paying for the part of the building it
will occupy, and the rest of the building is being financed by the
University, with the aid of a &#163;40,000 grant from the UGC.</p>

<p>The project has been designed by the University's architects, RMJM London
Ltd., in association with the University's Services Engineer.  The quantity
surveyors are Messrs. Franklin and Andrews.</p>

<p>As shown in the diagram, the new building is to be situated to the
west of the Physics and Electronics Building at the end of the wings,
in such a way that two new courtyards are created.  Its gross area will
be approximately 750 m&#178;.  The plan is organised around a corridor,
running north/south with large laboratories to the west side and TSO's
and small labs on the east.  The Electronics Centre is to the south
of the main entrance and reception area.</p>

<p>The main entrance will face west to the car park and is to be marked
by a lattice tower.  This supports the entrance canopy and will be
topped by disk aerials.</p>

<p>The building is to be single storey, brick faced with a low pitch
aluminum roof.  At the south end there will be an area of flat roof
where dish aerials will be mounted.  The structure will be steel
framed with partitions of dry construction.</p>

<p>Work on the main contract will start late September 1987, and will be
completed in April 1988.  There will be some preliminary work
undertaken in July in order to divert existing services.</p>

<p>The details of the scheme, for which planning permission is being sought,
will be considered by Estates and Buildings Committee on 30 June.  The
plans will be displayed in the Physics and Electronics Building during
July.</p>

time, to make research labs.</p>

<h2><a name="biology">Biology</a></h2>

The main architectural feature of the biology buildings is the tall
clock tower, with it's single face pointing towards (most) of campus.<p>

The building was damaged by a serious
<a href="morefire.html#bio">fire</a>in 1973.<p>

The Institute of Applied Biology, started in 1986 in the biology
department, moved to it's own buildings on 6 November 1989.  Money for the
buildings came from the University and from Rowntree plc.<p>

The Department of Biology Cancer Research Unit has the following plaque
on it's wall:
<p align=center>These laboratories were given to<br>
the University of York<br>
by the<br>
Yorkshire Cancer Research Campaign<br>
on 13 May 1980</p>

<p>A new set of labs was built during 1994, as reported by the November 1994
issue of <i>University Magazine</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
Professor Jo Milner and her research team have just moved in to their
new cell biology laboratory, in the ground floor of a new biology
laboratory complex.  Their research has led to important understanding
of the cancer growth suppressing function of a protein called p53.  The
Yorkshire Cancer Research Campaign, which funds Professor Milner's Chair
and supports the team's work in other ways, donated &#163;400,000 towards
the cost of the laboratory.

<p>Another greenhouse-type extension has been built during 1996, at first
floor level on the part of the old building nearest the plant lab.</p>

<h2><a name="plant">Plant Lab</a></h2>

<p>One of the most distinctive buildings on campus, the Biology Plant Lab was
opened in 1995, as reported in the June 1995 <i>University Magazine</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Importance of plant biology heralded by laboratory opening</strong>
</p>
<p>The official opening of the University's Plant Laboratory takes place
on Friday 2 June.</p>
<p>The laboratories have been purpose built to accommodate the  University's
rapidly expanding plant science research base.  The recent appointment of
a number of new researchers combined with existing strengths has resulted
in an impressive concentration of expertise in molecular plant science.</p>
<p>Research in the new laboratories is aimed at understanding fundamental
aspects of plant biology such as how plants recognise and respond to
environmental stimuli like wounding, nutrient stress, drought and shade.</p>
<p>Since we rely heavily on plants for basic necessities like clean air,
food, clothing and shelter, is is essential that we understand more about
plant biology.</p>
<p>``The Plant Laboratory provides an environment for a multi-disciplinary
group of enthusiastic and imaginative young scientists to work together,''
says Professor Dianna Bowles.  ``Increasingly, we are working with other
specialist groups on campus and with researchers in industry on novel
ideas in plant biology that will ultimately lead to new products in the
market place.</p>
<p>The plant research initiative has already been highly successful.  The
new building houses nine research groups comprising some 50 scientists.
The research income generated by York plant biologists has come to over
&#163;3m in the last year alone.</p>
<p>Funding has come from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council, The Royal Society, The Wolfson Foundation and from
leading UK companies including Zeneca, Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham, AgrEvo
and Unilever.</p>
<p>New links are being established with a number of European and US
industries.</p>
<p>The Plant Laboratory opening will be celebrated on a day on International
Science Lectures by some of the world's leading plant biologists.  They
include Professor Keith Roberts of the John Innes Centre, Professor
Ramon Serrano of the University of Valencia, Professor Jeff Schell of the
Max Plank Institute fur Zuchtungsforschung, and Professor Tom
Blundell FRS, of Birkbeck College.</p>

<h2><a name="psych">Psychology</a></h2>

<p>Psychology used to live above Wentworth A block, which is attached to
the rest of Wentworth by the glass-stairs thing in the air.  Plans were
made for their own building in 1974, when the department was first
formed, but due to government cutbacks it was never built.  Construction
of their new building started in 1993, with Phase 1 complete in January 1994.
The <i>University Magazine</i> (February 1994) reported on Phase 1:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Psychology's new home</strong></p>
<p>At the end of January the University took possession of the first phase
of the new home for the Psychology Department.  Having languished for nearly
20 years buried in converted study bedrooms in Wentworth College, the
Department asked architects Hunt Thompson Associates for a building with its
own distinct identity.  Now that the building is completed we can see how
well they have satisfied this brief.  Within a very tight budget the architects
have given us a new building of real interest of which even our last
Vice-Chancellor would be proud of!</p>
<p>The exterior is dominated by the circular tower (with its distinctive spiral
brickwork) which houses the main stairs, lift and provides circulation space.
It also forms the link to Phase 2 of the building, due to rise from the
mud later in the year.  The main block of the building, under a curved roof,
houses many of the facilities needed by the growing number of Psychology
undergraduates - a large, computer-based teaching laboratory, workshops,
test library and the departmental office - but rather little space for
staff and their research groups.  Only four members of the 14 strong
lecturing staff are moving their research laboratories into this first
phase of the building.</p>
<p>The realisation of this building and the allocation of funds for
phase 2 brings closer the day when all of the 5-star rated Psychology
Department will be under one roof and the Department's long quest for
a home will be over.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The commencement of Phase 2 was mentioned in <i>University Magazine</i>
November 1994:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Work begins on second phase of Psychology building</strong></p>
Phase two of the Psychology Department building will be constructed by
local company William Birch and Sons.<br>
The contract, worth &#163;903,000, began in October and will finish
in Sepember 1995.  The building will provide new lecture and seminar rooms
for undergraduate teaching and specialised laboratory space for the
Department's research groups.<br>
To make life easier for pedestrians during construction, a new floodlit pathway
leading across the front of Psychology to the Sports Centre, has been built
adjacent to the road which construction vehicles will use.<br>
Phase o nen of the new departmental building was completed in January.  With
the completion of Phase two, staff and students in one of Britain's most
successful Psychology Departments will finally be together on one site.
</blockquote>

<p>The final completion was described in the March 1996 issue
of <i>University Magazine</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fanfare for Psychology Opening</strong></p>
<p>On 17 February, the Psychology Department celebrated the opening of its new
building.  Dame Janet Baker unveiled the plaque and trumpeters assembled
on the tower of the building blasted out a fanfare as the Department's own
flag was hoisted to flutter above the campus.</p>

<p>Over &#163;2 million has been invested in the new building, which was
designed by architects Hunt Thompson Associates and constructed in two
phases.</p>
<p>Members of the Department and illustrious guests then gathered in
the teaching laboratory to hear the distinguished psychologist,
Professor Wichard Gregory, who is Emeritus Professor of Neuropsychology
at Bristol University, deliver an excellent lecture entitled `Why
Psychology is Special'.</p>
<p>The celebrations continued with refreshments and tours of the research
laboratories for the visitors.</p>
<p>The Department has waited a long time for its own building.  Student
numbers have climbed rapidly in recent years.  The annual intake of around
40 in 1989 has grown to over 100 in 1995.  On average 125 applications
are made for every place.  Its popularity with students coupled, with
its research strength - top rating in all three of the government's
research assessment exercises - has made Psychology one of the most
successful departments in the University.</p>
<p>Plucked from the obscurity of converted study-bedrooms in Wentworth
College, the Department of Psychology can at last enjoy first-rate
facilities for its wide range of research groups from human-computer
interaction to behavioural neuroscience from dyslexia to psycho-acoustics.</p>
</blockquote>

The new Psychology building bears the following plaque:
<p align=center>THIS BUILDING WAS OPENED<br>
ON 17 FEBRUARY 1996<br>
BY DAME JANET BAKER CH DBE<br>
CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY</p>

<p>This item from the July 1996 <i>University Magazine</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>University building in national exhibition</strong><br>
The new Psychology building has been selected from over 100 applications
to be represented in an exhibition of `Buildings for higher education'
organised by the RIBA Architecture Centre and the Higher Education
Design Quality Forum.
</blockquote>


<h2><a name="sports">Sports Centre</a></h2>

The original plans for the Sports Centre were reported in the
Thur 10th Feb 1966 issue of <i>Nouse</i> (full quote to follow at some point):<p>

<blockquote>
<b>New Sports Centre</b><p>

The completion date for the first stage of the University of York Sports
Centre is now in sight...<p>

The first stage has now been given U.G.C. approval and it is hoped to start on
 it this summer...<p>
</blockquote>

The plan shown includes a swimming pool at one end, 2x large halls,
squash courts, then a grandstand at the other end.  The first stage, that
which was authorised, was a hall and changing rooms.<p>

In 1989, a three-phase improvement plan was started.  Extra changing rooms
for outside sports were added, and the entrance area was improved with the
addition of reception, porters lodge and offices.  Work was carried out in
three phases, and was finally completed in the Winter 1990/1.<p>

<h3><a name="swim">Swimming Pool</a></h3>

<p>The quest for a swimming pool at York has been running for many long
years now.  More than once it has been announced that building was about to
start, such as this article from the <i>University Magazine</i> June 1994:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>All set for a splash</strong></p>
Whether you like to pound away at 20 lengths before breakfast, or splash
around at your leisure, a quick dash across campus for a swim is about to
become a reality.<br>
The University is set to realise a long-held ambition by building a
swimming pool.  Building work is expected to start this autumn.  The pool
will cost &#163;750,000 to build and the University already has
&#163;350,000 in grants and donations.<br>
The new pool will be situated between the Sport Centre and the Observatory.
</blockquote>
There is also a mention of the funding for the pool, in the October 1994
edition of <i>University Magazine</i>:

<blockquote>
...Now, at last. we expect to build a swimming pool, thanks to a
generous benefaction from Greg Dyke, Politics Department, 1971-74, and
a contribution of &#163;100,000 from the Foundation for Sports and the Arts.
A pool would serve the daily needs of up to 7,000 staff and students, and
some 40,000 visitors each year...
</blockquote>

<p>Sadly, staff and students get to stay dry for another year, as the pool
has yet to be built.  (Running costs are believed to have been the problem.)
The following article appeared in the March 1995
<i>University Magazine</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Scheme scuppered</strong><br>
Plans for a swimming pool on campus have been halted after Policy and
Resources Committee decided the scheme was too expensive.
</blockquote>

<p>(How <strong>do</strong> you scupper a swimming pool?  Oh well. Ed)</p>

<h3><a name="hockey">Hockey Pitch</a></h3>

<p>The latest addition to the sports facilities at York has been the
building of the floodlit astroturf hockey pitch, in the centre of the
running track.  This was partly funded by Greg Dyke, using the money
he had wanted to spend on a swimming pool (see above).  The hockey
pitches were used from summer 1996, but the official opening was
not until November, as described in the December 1996 <i>University
Magazine</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Floodlit hockey match launches York's new all-weather pitch
</strong></p>
<p>A team of former York students took on the Athletic Union President's
side in a floodlit hockey match at the opening of the University's new
all-weather pitch on Saturday 30 November.</p>
<p>The pitch was opened by Greg Dyke, Chairman and Chief Executive
of Pearson Television.  The new facility is designed to complement and
enhance local sport provision and provide a much-needed all-year-round
pitch.</p>
<p>The &#163;563,000 project includes a floodlit hockey pitch, five
changing rooms and car parking.  The pitch is available for full-scale
hockey matches, five aside football, and practice sessions for other
sports.</p>
<p>Floodlighting to enable the pitch to be used all year round is
adjustable with high settings for matches, lower settings for training
and the ability to light half and one-third areas for small-scale uses,
thus saving on energy costs.</p>
<p>The building of the pitch was generously funded by Greg Dyke, a former
student of the University, and the Foundation for Sport and the Arts.  The
pitch will be known as the JLD Hockey Pitch in memory of Greg Dyke's
father Joseph Leonard Dyke.</p>
<p>``The pitch is a significant addition to our sports facilities'', said
Colin Smith, Director of the Sports Centre.  ``Not only will it help us in
attracting students to the University, but it is an important part of
the region's sports facilities.  Current users of the new pitch include
York Men's and Ladies' Hockey Clubs, York City Football Club, Fulford
School, the University College of Ripon and York St John, St Peter's
School and Dunnington Football Club.  University hockey is also
flourishing as a result of this pitch: we are currently running three
men's and two ladies' teams.''</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="iriss">IRISS</a></h2>

<p>The IRISS buildings are built in the modern campus style of
yellow brick and dark tiled roof.  Work started in 1988, and is
mentioned in the University <i>News Sheet</i>, Issue 200 (May 1988).
The total cost of the development was estimated at &#163;1.6m.</p>

<h2><a name="music">Music</a></h2>

<p>The new extension of the Music Department was started in 1991, as
described by this article from <i>News Sheet</i> Issue 219 (March 1991):</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Work begins on new Music extension</strong></p>
<p>Work has just begun on an unusual new building for the Music
Department.</p>
<p>The extension, a single storey building linked to the rest of the
Department by a covered way, will curve around to enclose an attractive
landscaped area and will incorporate an overlooking glass-windowed
corridor.  It will be of traditional construction in facing
brickwork to harmonise with the existing building and will have a
natural slate roof overhanging the eaves level windows to
provide sun protection.</p>
<p>The extension will provide additional rehearsal and practice space
and will include a small hexagonal auditorium which will mirror
the stage area of the Sir Jack Lyons Concert Hall so that rehearsals
can be easily transferred to the main hall.  The building will
also provide a new home for the south east Asian Gamelan and
Pi-phat ensembles.</p>
<p>Mike Nicholas and Rob Marsh of Nicholas Associates are the architects
in charge of the building which will be finished in September ready for
the new academic year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The opening was covered by <i>News Sheet</i> in December 1991 (issue
225):</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>New Music Extension opens</strong></p>
<p>The new extension to the Music Department is up and running.  The single-storey
building linked to the rest of the Department by a covered way comprises
rehearsal and practice space and includes a small hexagonal auditorium
which mirrors the stage area of the Sir Jack Lyons Concert Hall.</p>
<p>It also provides a new home for the Javanese Gamelan and Thai Piphat
ensembles.</p>
<p>The building curves around to enclose a small landscaped area and
has been built in brick to harmonise with the existing building.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="lyons">Sir Jack Lyons Concert Hall</a></h3>

<p>A concert hall featured in the original development plan, attached
to a music department, but could not at first be built to to a lack of
money.  Sir Jack Lyons donated the &#163;120,000 needed by
the University to build the hall, and his wife donated the cost of t he
ebest piano that could be found.</p>

<p>The hall seats 500 people, and the stage layout is duplicated by
a Music Department practice room.</p>

<h2><a name="compsci">Computer Science</a></h2>

<p>(Computing Science <i>computer</i> history
is on a <a href="compcomps.html">separate page</a>.</p>

<p>The computer science department has a history of upgrading to new
accomodation.  Formed in the late 70's out of the <a href="computation.html">computation
department</a>, which lived in the two original blocks, the department
has had offices in Chemistry, Vanbrugh and X/A block (amongst other places).</p>

<p>The main building (X/D block) went live in '85-ish.
This was joined by X/E block in 88 (real-time and high-integrity groups
initially), and X/T (portakabin initially used by HISE comp. sci
researchers, then ITBML) in '91. This was built right over a water main and
had to have a large hole made in its floor, in addition to lacking a
toilet. It was a cold and rather bleak place to work.  The department kept *nearly*
leaving Vanbrugh -- computer architecture group was replaced there by what
later became the Intelligent Systems Group. X/U block was added in 1992.</p>

<p>In the courtyard between the old and new buildings there is a
large chessboard in the paving stones.</p>

<p>The new building has a weather vane at one end, calibrated in radians
rather than the more conventional NESW.</p>

<p>Work is now (Autumn 1996) under way on a still newer building, to go
next to the library.
Most of the Computer Science buildings will apparently be given to EEMS
when the new building near the library is complete.
It was mentioned in the February 1996 <i>University
Magazine</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Computer Science building to go ahead</strong></p>
<p>Outline planning consent has been given for the new Computer Science
Building.  All being well, work will begin on the site in June this year.
Completion is scheduled for September 1997.  Permission has also been
given for 17 acres of playing fields to be built on land near the
golf club.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can keep up to date with the construction of the new building,
thanks to <a href="http://dcpu1.cs.york.ac.uk:6666/riws/building/latest.html">this
link to Computer Science.</a></p>

<p>The original plan was to build an access road round the back of the
library. Plan scrapped, (reason unknown). Instead the current access
road for the construction vehicles would be used as the main feed
road. So the same single foreman, who is in charge of the
construction sight and the road construction had put in the
plans/project details that the road would be built, surfaced and
completed over a number of weeks.
Unfortunately, that time was also the time he had allocated for the
moving of the dept, so there was going to be the department, all
ready to move into but no road to get to it (they would have to tear
up the current access road as it has no drainage.)
The problem remains unsolved at this stage, though it looks like they
will build a temporary road next to the existing road for the dept to
move in, tear up the existing road, resurface it, then remove the
temporary road.</p>

<h2><a name="health">University Health Centre</a></h2>

<p>Originally, the University Medical Centre was in converted rooms in
Vanbrugh B block, at the
corner near X block.  It was moved to a purpose-built building, and renamed,
in 1994.  This article comes from the <i>University Magazine</i>, January 1994:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>University Health Centre opens for business</strong></p>

<p>The University's new Health Centre, set between the
Physics/Electronics building and the Vice-Chancellor's house, opened on
7 January.  The purpose-built Centre has three consulting suites, two
treatment rooms, a sick bay with adjoining night nurse accomodation,
multi-purpose nurse's interview room and office, a conference room and
a spacious waiting room with a welcoming reception area which includes
confidential facilities.</p>

<p>``The Centre has been built to our requirements and provides first class
facilities on campus for health care,'' said Dr Keith Price.  ``There is
room for further expansion of services and we have full facilities for
the disabled as well as 24 hour nursing cover throughout the week during
term.  We now have a perfect opportunity to involve the full Primary
Health Care Team on campus and, in our role as GP fundholders, we will be able
to provide a greater variety of health care services.''</p>

<p>``One of the special things about the Centre is its site,'' said John
McNeil of McNeil and Beechey Architects. ``It stands on the edge of
the tree nursery overlooking the lake and in the spring the Centre will be
surrounded by flowers amongst the trees.  The building has been designed to
make the most of this wih continuous glazing providing pleasant views from
all of the rooms.''</p>

<p>The building has been finished to a high standard on difficult site
conditions.  ``The builders, William Birch, and their subcontractors are
to be congratulated,'' said John McNeil.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="nursery">University Nursery</a></h2>

<p>The Nursery occupies a quiet site behind the Physics Department on
campus.  It was opened in 1989, and was extended in 1994 to include a
Baby Unit, opened on 14 October by the Chancellor.</p>

<h2><a name="sc">Student Centre</a></h2>

<p>York S.U. are still battling to get a `proper SU building', but for the
time being they have offices and stuff in the converted squash courts
next to Goodricke Bar.  The news was reported in the January 1995 issue
of <i>University Magazine</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>New Student Centre opens</strong></p>
<p>The Students' Union and its key affiliates have been brought together
for the first time in a new Student Centre next to Goodricke College.</p>
<p>Students' Union Officers, RAG, Community Action Project, the Overseas
Students' Association and the Graduate Students' Association moved into
the new building in December.</p>
<p>The building also provides space for non-sabatical officers and for
several Students' Union societies.</p>
<p>The new Student Centre has been converted from a building containing
two squash courts.  Twenty-four windows were inserted into a previously
windowless building, changing rooms were converted into toilets and a new
fire escape and a lift for disabled access have been added.</p>
<p>The conversion cost around &#163;240,000 with contributions towards
that of &#163;88,000 from the Students' Union and &#163;12,000 from the
Graduate Students' Association.</p>
<p>``We now have much better facilities,'' said Jon Bloch, Deputy President
(Services). ``Previously we worked in very cramped conditions in our
Goodricke Colleges offices.''</p>
<p>The Union President, the Deputy President (Services) and RAG and CAP staff
work in an open plan area upstairs designed to make the Union more
accessible to its members.  The Welfare Information Officer and
Deputy President (Welfare) have their own offices to preserve confidentiality,
as do the Finance Officer and the Administrative Officer.</p>
<p>On the ground floor there is a general office and reception, where the
new receptionist Caroline Snowdon greets visitors, the AU offices, a joint
GSA/OSA office and a print room.</p>
<p>``The Students' Union and its affiliates would like all students to
feel that they can use the building's facilities,'' said Jon Bloch, ``and
we hope that they will aid the Students' Union in its efforts to improve
services for students on campus.''</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="careers">Careers Centre</a></h2>

<p>The careers centre was built in 1985, at the same time as the
Computer Science building.  It has a large grey box on the roof,
purpose unknown.</p>

<h2><a name="drama">Drama Barn</a></h2>

<p>The drama barn stands between Vanbrugh College and the Music Department.
Part of this building dates back to the 19th century, and was part of
Bleachfield Farm which used to stand on the site.</p>
